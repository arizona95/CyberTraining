      <!-- BEGIN: Transport from early SY110 networking material - netStack - Stack -->
      <p>
        In this lesson, we discuss basic aspects of networking, and introduce the TCP/IP Stack, the most common networking stack employed across the globe.
        The TCP/IP Stack is based on the concept of <em>layering</em>, in which the various networking <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#P">protocols</a> are separated into distinct layers, each with a specific purpose.
      </p>
      <div id="intro">
        <h3>Introduction: Networks, Hosts, Protocols, Services, and Utilities</h3>
        <p>
          The basic purpose of <em>networking</em> is to provide a means for two remote entities to communicate with each other.
        </p>
        <div class="annotation" style="clear:right;">
          There is a protocol that defines <a href="../../watch-7.html?v=fVq4_HhBK8Y">radio communication between aircraft and control towers</a> (<cite>Airplane</cite>).
          Look at the following transcripts, and see if you can identify the rules governing things like: identifying yourself and the entity you want to communicate with, acknowledging receipt of message, and turn-taking.<br><br>
          BR51: "Tower, BR51 request takeoff VFR to the West."<br>
          Tower: "BR51, Tower, you are cleared for takeoff to the West."<br>
          BR51: "Tower, BR51, copy, cleared for takeoff."<br><br>
          This second transcript shows a different pattern in terms of turn-taking.<br><br>
          BR51: "Dulles Tower, this is Bay Raider 51, 35 miles to the West, final stop Dulles."<br>
          Tower: "Standby"<br>
          Tower: "BR51, this is Dulles, cleared to Dulles"<br>
          BR51 : "Tower, BR51, copy, cleared to Dulles."
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Network</strong>.
            A common definition of a <em><a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#N">network</a></em> is a collection of interconnected computers, such that the computers can pass messages between each other.
            A more general definition that could additionally apply to social networks is that a <em>network</em> is a collection of entities that can communicate across a common medium.
            In this course we will focus on the information system context of networking; i.e. computer networks, but realize there are other types of networks in the cyber domain.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Host</strong>.
            A <em><a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#H">host</a></em> is a computer connected to a network.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Protocols</strong>.
            <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#C">Computers</a> and networked computer systems are hugely complex.
            Only by employing very careful, highly structured design can we humans deal with that complexity.
            The idea of a protocol and a <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#P">protocol stack</a> is at the heart of that design.
            A <em>protocol</em> is just an agreement about communication between to communicating parties &mdash; a complete specification of what things can be said, what responses can and must be made, and what these things mean.
            Protocols abound outside of the world of digital communication, but in digital communications protocols are extremely important.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Services</strong>.
            Protocols often revolve around providing a <em>service</em>.
            They govern the back-and-forth communication between the entity providing the service and the entity using the service.
            That boils down to specifying what messages can be sent and what those messages mean, e.g. what action results from sending that message.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Utilities</strong>.
            For many protocols, and their associated services, there are standard utilities for accessing them.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In subsequent lessons, we will explore some of these protocols, services, and utilities.
          For now, though, let's take a look at different <em>types</em> of protocols, and how they interact.
        </p>

        <h1>Tactical Voice Communications</h1>

        <div style="text-align:justify">
          The document <a href="http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp125/ACP125F.pdf">ACP 125</a> gives a protocol for communications between Allied Forces on tactical voice nets, to <em>"provide a standardized way of passing speech and data traffic."</em>
          The protocol specifies such things as a <a href="../../wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet.html"><strong>phonetic alphabet</strong></a> ("ALFA, BRAVO, ..., ZULU"), <a href="../../wiki/Procedure_word.html"><strong>prowords</strong></a> (e.g., "say again", "roger" ), <img src="calendar-17.php?key=a88aa70976ae8c1a6ee36ec4098bda6d592798cb&type=class&event=17" style="width:140px; float:right; padding:10px 2px 0px 10px;" title="U.S. Navy photo by MCSN Danian Douglas/Released"> how to unambiguously record a message (e.g., zero written as: &Oslash;, letter Z written as: &#x01B5;), and <a href="../../wiki/Brevity_code.html"><strong>brevity codes</strong></a> (e.g. the brief phrase "Birds away" means "Friendly surface-to-air missiles have been fired at the designated target").<br>
          When you pick up that VHF bridge-to-bridge radio on one of the YP's, the ACP 125 protocol tells you how you should talk!

          Here's an example dialog between call signs S7 and CC:

<strong>S7</strong>: "This is Sierra Seven, roger, over."
<strong>CC</strong>: "Sierra Seven, Charlie Charlie, immediate

          <p>
            The different protocols that make up the <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#I">Internet</a> are organized into what's viewed as stacked layers.
            A quick note, the <em>Internet</em> and the <em>web</em> are not the same thing; we will clarify the distinction between both in the coming discussions.
            Before we define this model, called the TCP/IP Stack, we will consider an analogy.

            <strong>Mail Analogy</strong>.
            In simple correspondence by snail mail, say you and Grandma are writing letters and cards, we can view the whole process as consisting of four layers:

          <p>
            In this model, there are two important features:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Each layer has a specific, well-defined role &mdash; the service it provides</li>
            <li>Each layer only needs to know how to interact with the layers directly above and directly below</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            As the letter travels down one side of the stack, over to the other side at the bottom layer, then up the stack on other side &mdash; these interactions are governed each by their own protocol.
            For example, to send a letter via the Correspondent Layer you need to follow the addressing, stamping rules, and you need to signal to Carrier Layer that the letter is ready for pick up (raise flag, drop in mail box).
            What happens after that doesn't matter to you, as long as the letter is not returned.
            To receive, of course, you just have to know to check your mail box.
            Once again, how the other layers operate is not something you, at the Correspondent Layer, need to know about.
            If you're operating at the Carrier Layer, you just need to know: where to pick up your bag of letters at the post office, how to read the addresses so you can deliver letters to mail boxes, and where at the post office to bring the outgoing letters you picked up from peoples' mail boxes along your route.
            The messages between the Correspondents, and whether the letters will be sent via train or ship by the Shipping layer are both irrelevant to you.
            And so it goes with the other layers as well.
            Any individual within this system can be identified as acting at one of these layers, whether it's Grandma, Mr. McFeely the Postman <!-- Mr. Roger's Neighborhood -->, or Jenny the C-2 Pilot.

            <strong>The TCP/IP Stack &ndash; Networking Layers</strong>.
            In the mail example, we started with a system we already knew all about and understood well, and organized it into a layered protocol stack.
            Now, we'll start with the layered protocol stack organization for the Internet; we'll learn about and discuss the Internet based on the TCP/IP Stack.
            The layers in the TCP/IP stack are:

-----------------</pre>
          <p>
            <strong>Application Layer</strong>.
            The Application Layer is about <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#P">programs</a> running on different <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#H">hosts</a> that want to communicate &mdash; like you and Grandma in our snail mail analogy.
            Our most familiar example of an application layer protocol is HTTP, the protocol that governs communication between web servers and browsers; example the communications between the Chrome web browser on your laptop and Facebook.
            Ideally, web servers and browsers need to know two things: the language they speak to one another (the HTTP protocol), and the protocol that governs interactions with the next layer down: the Transport Layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Transport Layer</strong>.
            To understand the Transport Layer, we should really understand what kind of service application-layer programs need.
            Let's focus on the application-layer programs we're most familiar with: web-servers and web-clients.
            Basically, a client needs to send a bunch of <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#B">bytes</a> to the server (its request), and then waits around and ultimately receive a bunch of bytes from the server (the server's   response).
            The server needs the reverse.
            This is the <em>service</em> browsers and web servers need the Transport Layer to provide.
            In the case of HTTP, the browser specifies the host it wants to connect to, the bytes it wants sent and waits around for an answer.
            In order to make a connection, send all those bytes, and receive the response bytes back, the Transport Layer has to on one side break the request/response message up into small pieces and wrap each piece up with an address to form a <em>datagram</em>, and on the other side reconstitute the received datagrams into a full message.
            Getting each individual datagram from one host to the other is not the business of the Transport Layer.
            That's done by the next layer down: the Network Layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Network Layer</strong>.
            The Network Layer is responsible for routing <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#P">packets</a> across the Internet from the source host to the destination host through the various networks that make up the Internet.
            The protocol that governs it, the <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#I">Internet Protocol</a> (IP), defines what constitutes a valid address and what format the bytes that make up a packet have to follow.
            What's interesting is that IP makes no guarantees about delivering packets.
            Packets may get to their destination ... or not.
            A sequence of packets sent from one host to another may arrive in the proper order ... or not.
            The service is fundamentally <em>unreliable</em>.
            You're only guaranteed <em>best effort</em> delivery.
            (Same with MIDN.  We prof's are not guaranteed that Midshipman X will learn the material, only that we'll get Midshipman X's best effort.
            We are guaranteed of that, right? ... right?)
            If some kind of guarantee of delivery and proper ordering is required, that guarantee becomes an extra duty of the Transport Layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Data Link Layer</strong>.
            The Network Layer routes packets between different networks.
            Actually getting the packet between hosts within the same network is the job of the Data Link Layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Physical Layer</strong>. The lowest layer is the Physical layer is wires and radio waves.
            Relatively little of what goes on in this course deals with this layer directly, so we won't say too much about it.
            In EC310 &ndash; Cyber II, you'll learn a lot more about it; oh, it's good to remember that the material you are learning in <script type="text/javascript">document.write(crsNum);</script> will be used in future courses.
          </p>

            Proposals have been submitted for <em>IP over Avian Carriers</em> (i.e. sending Internet traffic with carrier pigeons).
            See <a href="../../wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers.html">this Wikipedia entry</a>.
            It's a joke, of course, but when you have a whole lot of data to send on a light enough storage medium (USB drive), a small enough distance to travel, and a good pigeon (or African Swallow <!-- Monty Python -->), it's actually faster than dial up!
          </div>
          <p>At the source, the process is known as <b><em>encapsulation</em></b>.
            The Application Layer protocol has data, a message, that it wants to send.
            The Transport Layer protocol adds header information to the message, and sends the datagram to the Network Layer.
            The Network Layer protocol adds its header information, and sends the packet to the Data Link Layer.
            Next, the Network Layer protocol adds its header and footer information, and sends the frame across the Physical Layer.
            In the diagram below, the Data Link Layer (Link Layer) information is in the Frame Header and Frame Footer.
            The mechanics of the physical layer vary significantly by connection type.
          </p>
          <img src="calendar.php-35.png?key=761ff4669490a5f85a4fba480d8b6f18b8302385&type=class&event=17" style="height:250pt;">
          <p>
            At the destination, the process is reversed, and is known as <b><em>de-encapsulation</em></b>.
            When the frame arrives at the Data Link Layer from the Physical Layer, the frame header and footer are stripped away, and the packet is passed to the Network Layer.
            There, the Network Layer data are stripped away, and the datagram goes to the Transport Layer.
            The Transport Layer strips away the last of the header information, and passes the message to the Application Layer program.

            <strong>TCP/IP Stack Summary</strong>.
            To summarize the upper three layers, which are most important to us in this course:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Processes, programs in execution, that communicate via the Internet to <u>provide services directly to users</u> (web, video-conferencing, file sharing, etc) operate at the <em>Application Layer</em>.
              The Application Layer includes protocols, like HTTP, that govern the way the processes communicate.</li>
            <li>The <em>Transport Layer</em> is responsible for getting data <em>from a <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#P">process</a> on Host A to a process on Host B</em>.
              One important way this is accomplished is through the packet's source and destination <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#P">port numbers</a>.
              The Transport Layer includes protocols like TCP and UDP.</li>
            <li>The <em>Network Layer</em> is responsible for getting packets <em>from Host A to Host B</em>.
              One way it does this is by specifying the source and destination IP Addresses in the packet.
              The IP protocols (<a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#I">IPv4</a> and <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#I">IPv6</a>) operate at the Network Layer.</li>

      <h2>Introduction to the Physical Layer</h2>
      <p>
        Physical Layer protocols are focused on transmitting and receiving digital data across a transmission medium.
        Details of issues that a physical layer protocol needs to address are beyond the scope of <script type="text/javascript">document.write(crsNum);</script>, and involve Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering.
        As such, your Junior year course (EC310) run by the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department will focus on digital communications at the Physical Layer more.
        We introduce the basics of the Physical Layer, and discuss a few terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Physical Layer focuses on converting digital data (<a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#B">bits</a> and <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#B">bytes</a>) into a <em>digital signal</em>, and sending and receiving digital signals.
        A digital signal is simply an encoding of digital data for transmission in the electromagnetic spectrum.
        The digital signal is then sent (transmitted) across the <em>transmission medium</em>.
        There are three common mediums that digital signals are transmitted across: cables or wires (electricity through copper/silicon), fibre (light through glass), or wirelessly (radio frequency through and around space, air, ground, and water).
        In the Fleet and Marine Corps we use a mix of all three communication mediums.
      </p>
      <div class="annotation">
        The Internet is comprised of links that span the globe.
        Explore <a href="../../index-15.htm">this map</a> of the cables that run across the oceans interconnecting the different continents and bodies of land.
        There's another version for those that prefer <a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/InternetTube.png">subway maps</a>.
      </div>

      <p>
        Since the Physical Layer focuses solely on transmitting and receiving digital signals, any errors that arise during transmission have to be addressed by a layer higher up the TCP/IP Stack. An example of such a Physical Layer error would be interference you hear on an over the air radio station (i.e. not a satellite radio station) in a car when you are near the outer range of coverage. Another example would be active jamming of a frequency by an adversary.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Physical Layer - Hardware (Hub)</h3>
      <p>
        A hub itself does not have any means of addressing traffic to a specific host, it merely listens for and retransmits frames. If hosts on the same network are connected by a hub, we have a reasonable picture of how things work. However, hubs are not often used these days for an obvious reason: it's extremely inefficient to have every host on the network receive a copy of every frame sent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider this simple example.
        Imagine that Alice, Bob, Ciana, and Ralph are all connected via a hub.
        Alice and Bob start a conversation, Alice and Bob follow their communications protocol and take turns sending messages.
        While this is happening Ciana and Ralph start a conversation, but in doing so the frames of Ciana and Ralph's conversation start colliding with the frames of Alice and Bob's conversation, thus wrecking their conversation.<!-- Wreck-It Ralph -->
        Having too many hosts connected via a hub or a chain of hubs can quickly lead to many collisions.
        If there are too many collisions, then the entire network becomes unusable, so much so that Felix can't fix it.<!-- Wreck-It Ralph-->
        Hmm, what pillar is associated with being able to use a service? Right, availability.
        Is there another pillar that we might be concerned with when using a hub?
        What if Alice doesn't want Ralph to know that she is talking to Bob?
        Confidentiality starts to come into question if frames are broadcast out to all other hosts on the local network by a hub.
      </p>


      <p>
        For those reasons hubs are rarely seen in wired networks anymore. As we will learn in the next lesson, Networking - Data-Link Layer, instead of a hub we use a <em>switch</em>. Even though a switch looks very similar to a hub, a switch is more capable (provides more services) than a hub. A switch is smarter than a hub, in that it only retransmits frames down the port (physical connection) the destination host is connected via, rather than retransmitting each frame to every network segment (port). That means that if Alice and Bob are on different network segments than Ciana and Ralph, then Alice and Bob's conversation will not interfere (collide) with Ciana and Ralph's conversation. Additionally, neither Ciana nor Ralph will see the frames of Alice and Bob's conversation, there by supporting confidentiality.
