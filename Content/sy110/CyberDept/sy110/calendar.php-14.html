      We will look at a few examples of software errors that have a major impact to the U.S. military.  As you read through these case studies, reflect on how many devices and services you interact with and rely upon on a daily basis that are controlled by computer programs.

      In 1997, the US Navy was testing a new Smart Ship system onboard the <i>USS Yorktown</i> in an attempt to minimize manpower requirements and operating cost.  The system automated a number of ship control systems to include the propulsion system.  A major casualty occurred onboard when a sailor input the number zero into a program that then used that value as the divisor in division (dividing by zero).  The resulting calculation caused the computer to crash and an error to cascade throughout the local network on the ship, crippling the Smart Ship system.  The loss of the Smart Ship computers caused what Atlantic Fleet officials called "an engineering local area network casualty."  From the perspective of the sailors, the <i>Yorktown</i> was dead in the water in open ocean for almost three hours.

      The MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile defense system that uses an advanced radar system to detect, classify, and track airborne objects.  After an initial detection, the weapons control software in the Patriot system limits the area in space in which the radar is looking to where it anticipates the object will have traveled to at that point in time.  In 1991, the weapons control software has a software error that caused the system to lose accuracy in tracking incoming targets the longer the Patriot battery was left running continuously  (analysis showed a 50% loss of precision after 20 consecutive hours of operation).  On February 25, 1991, a Scud tactical ballistic missile was fired at Dharhran Air Base in Saudi Arabia which was then protected by a Patriot missile battery that had been operating for over 100 consecutive hours.  The software error in the weapons control software led to failure of the Patriot system to track the incoming Scud, which impacted an Army barracks and killed 28 American soldiers.

      The F-22 Raptor, a fifth-generation stealth tactical aircraft, uses a fly-by-wire system in which computer software controls the aircraft's control surfaces to yield the movements ordered by the pilot.  In 1992, the first flying F-22 crashed during a test flight when a physical oscillation of the aircraft went outside of the expected parameters in the flight control software.  The oscillation origination from the pilot executing two concurrent operations (retracting the landing gear and igniting the afterburners).

      In 2001, a B-52 bomber performed an airstrike in Kandahar with saddening results – three members of U.S. Special Forces were caught in the blast and killed.  The U.S. forces were using a precision GPS device to provide the coordinates of Taliban forces for the B-52-launched JDAM.  While Special Forces were providing the position for the airstrike, the GPS device battery died.  After the battery had been replaced and the device powered on, the GPS device's software began its normal startup sequence and reset the targeting position for the airstrike to its own location.

      <h4>Code Examples</h4>
      The above case studies involved complex software that involved thousands to millions of lines of code.  It is easy to imagine how difficult it might be to make sure there are no mistakes in programs of that size.  To help reinforce this idea, we will look at some shorter code examples that have critical but not obvious flaws.  There will be two code examples side-by-side that seem to perform the same function, but one of the two will fail in certain cases.

      In this example both programs will properly add up the numbers between 1 and some number provided by the user.  However, what happens when the user provides a negative number as an input to the program?  The program on the right will not perform any calculation and simply output a total value of zero, which one might argue is not the correct, or anticipated, behavior.  The program on the left suffers much more significantly as it enters an infinite loop that will eventually crash your browser window.

      Both programs are simplified examples of what might be running on the nearest ATM.  Starting with an initial set balance, they allow the user to withdraw a user-defined amount of money from their account.  What happens if you try to withdraw a negative amount of money?  Think about the user providing a negative value will affect the arithmetic calculation <code>balance = balance - n;</code>.  If <code>n</code> is negative, then the balance will go up!  While most ATMs don't have this specific vulnerability, ATM software has been susceptible to <a href="../../2014/11/nashville/index.htm">multiple hacks</a>;

      <h2>Boolean Operators: <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>!</code></h2>

        <ul style="list-style:none">
          <li><b><code>||</code></b> — the expression <code>a || b</code> is <code>true</code> if either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> is <code>true</code>.</li>
          <li><b><code>&amp;&amp;</code></b> — the expression 
          <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> is <code>true</code> only if
          both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are <code>true</code>.</li>
          <li><b><code>&nbsp;!</code></b> — the expression <code>!a</code> is <code>false</code> if <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>, and <code>true</code> if <code>a</code> is <code>false</code> (logical negation).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
      These <em>boolean operators</em> can help us make programs that more efficiently handle a wide-range of user input as we will see below.

    Bugs in the JavaScript Interpreter
    and the 2008 PWN2OWN Contest
  </b><br>
  The bugs that we've looked at so far
  (possibility of infinite loops, bad input crashing programs,
  and unexpected input allowing us to cheat at games)
  are all problems with JavaScript <em>programs</em>. Only the
  writers and users of these programs need to worry about them.
  A much deeper and more worrisome problem arises when there is
  a bug in the JavaScript <em>interpreter</em>.  When that
  happens, a malicious JavaScript program can take advantage of
  the bug in the interpreter to actually make the user's browser
  or even the user's PC do bad things.
  <p>
    Every year the security conference CanSecWest holds the
    PWN2OWN contest, where participants try to exploit (take
    advantage of) bugs in browsers in order to "PWN" a
    computer whose browser visited their web page. Essentially,
    you've pwned a computer if you can get it to execute <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#S">shell</a>
    commands of your choosing &amp; preferably in an
    administrator/root shell.  In 2008, one group took advantage
    of a bug in Apple's Safari browser's JavaScript interpreter
    to pwn a MacBook Air.  In other words, the MacBook Air's
    browser followed a <a class="glossLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#L">link</a> to this groups evil web page, and two
    minutes later they were able to send shell commands to the
    MacBook Air and have it execute them.
    Check out
    <a href="../../2008/03/28/mac_hack/index.htm">this
    2008 news article</a> or, if you really want to know, you
    can look at

 <h3>But Not Everything Is a Cyber Attack</h3>
    <p>
    Information systems can fail for many reasons, not just because they have been attacked in cyberspace. They have failed before there were hackers,
    and in a utopia where hackers do not exist, they would still fail from time to time. Sources of failure can be internal - faulty administration, feckless
    users, poorly-written software, or low-quality hardware. Systems and the machines they control can also fail from external factors such as natural
    events (weather, earthquakes, animals, ...), human-caused accidents, or operator error. To quote the former Deputy Director of NSA (and a member of our cyber faculty Chris Inglis),
    "I don't think paralysis [of the electrical grid] is more likely by cyber-attack than by natural disaster. And frankly the number-one threat experienced to
    date by the US electrical grid is squirrels." Check out Inside Energy's, "Data: Explore 15 Years of Power Outages" <a href="../../2014/08/18/data-explore-15-years-of-power-outages/index.htm"> report</a>
     for an in-depth look at what causes power-outages ... or for some fun, checkout the <a href="../../index-9.htm">Cyber Squirrel</a> website to 
     see all their ongoing operations against wires worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are two lessons here. First, just because your system failed does not mean that hackers were at fault. Although we should always be alert to the
    possibility that failure was induced, we should always be receptive to the possibility that failure stemmed from other causes. Second, just because
    you've protected your system against hackers does not mean that your systems will not fail. There must always be contingency plans to carry out the
    mission based on the possibility of failure.

      <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
      Malware is <em>mal</em>icious soft<em>ware</em> &mdash; that is to say programs that violate one or more of the Five Pillars of IA (unbeknownst to the user under whose account it is running).  Note that malware does not generally refer to software with unintentional bugs that adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system.
    <p>
      Malware usually represents a different approach to attacking a system than the network attacks we've discussed, because the victim generally installs the malware or takes some action that results in the malware being installed &mdash; not realizing what they're doing, of course. In other words, instead of breaking into a system, we trick users into inviting us in.  I'm reminded of vampires and how they have to be invited in.

    <p class="sec">
      <h2>Virus</h2>
      This term is the most broadly used word to describe unwanted programs on our computers. A computer virus is a computer program that can replicate itself and "infect" a computer without permission or knowledge of the user. A virus might corrupt or delete data on a computer, or even the whole hard drive.
    
  <p>
      A virus will attach itself to another program or file on your computer. Most often they will attach to executables, and cannot run unless the executable file is executed. A virus cannot spread past your computer without some human action assisting. There are many different kinds of viruses including:
      
    <ul class="inst">
        <li>
    Macro: A virus written in a macro language for a separate application, such as a word processor.
          Some programs allow macro programs to be embedded in documents (Microsoft
          Office products), this provides a unique vector for
          viruses. A famous example is
    the <a href="../../definition/Melissa-virus.html" target="_blank">Melissa virus</a>.
    The virus was a macro inside a Microsoft Word document named <code>List.DOC</code>. A <em>macro</em> embedded in a Word document is exactly analogous to a script embedded in a web page: when the word document is opened, the macro is executed. In the case of the Melissa virus, the macro/script did some bad things, including sending e-mails out to the first 50 addresses in your "address book" that had <code>List.DOC</code> as attachments, thereby propagating itself.
  </li>

    <li>
    Program virus: This is the most traditional virus, a stand-alone executable program attached to some other file (which usually looks benign).
  </li>
  
    <li>
    Boot sector: A virus that starts every time computer boots. This can be mitigated by setting this area on the disk to read-only, so that only the Administrator can override.
  </li>
      </ul>
    
    How a virus can make copies of itself (i.e. how a virus could "propagate") may seem like a bit of a mystery.  To help understand and make things a bit more concrete we looked in class at the following virus for our message board <span class="red">(NOTE: The Javascript function encodeURIComponent( ) takes a string and encodes it in the form it should have to be in a URL calling a server side script.)</span>:
  <br><br>
    <pre>
&lt;em id="foo"&gt;
I love SY110!
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
if(Math.random()&lt;0.05)
{
  document.location="mb.cgi?msg="
  +
  encodeURIComponent('&lt;em id="foo"&gt;' + document.getElementById("foo").innerHTML + '&lt;/em&gt;');
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;</pre>
    Someone has to post this to the message board initially.  For anyone visiting the message board subsequently, they see the message <em>I love SY110!</em>, but what they don't see is that their browser executes the script.  There is a 95% chance that the script will do nothing.  But, the other 5% of the time it sends a message to the server that posts a copy of itself on the message board, except that the username attached to that message will be of the victim, i.e. the user who's just visited the message board. The script uses <code>document.getElementById("foo").innerHTML</code> to get a copy of itself, which is how it can reproduce.  When your instructor demoed this in class, you should have gotten a feeling for the nasty nature of exponential growth!
    

        <p class="sec">
        <h2>Worms</h2>
        A computer <em>worm</em> is a self-replicating, self-propagating program that uses networking mechanisms to spread itself. This is a virus with the added functionality of spreading across a network without any help from a user. This is in contrast with most viruses and Trojans, which rely on the unwitting help of users. A worm typically scans the surrounding network and then exploits specific vulnerabilities in the host operating systems or services via an open port and then transfers itself to the new host. There are also other methods of propagation.
    
        <div class="annotation">
            The Stuxnet worm targeted Siemens Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.
            <center><img src="calendar-15.php?key=d20b837a6df1596f9b0accda686d5d3e41664d4a&type=class&event=11" height="286" width="425"></center>
        </div>
    
        <p>
        Some famous examples:
        <ul>

            <li><a href="../../wiki/Stuxnet.html" target="_blank">Stuxnet</a></li>
            <li><a href="../../wiki/Conficker.html" target="_blank">Conficker</a></li>
        </ul>
        

    <p class="sec">
        <h2>Trojan Horse</h2>
        A trojan horse is named for the famous Greek story of ancient times. In the computer world, a trojan horse is a program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invoked the program. In contrast to viruses, Trojans don't try to propagate &mdash; they don't try to replicate themselves or send themselves to other machines.  In fact, "trojan" refers to the mechanism by which the malware is delivered not really to the malware itself.  Once malware is delivered via a trojan, in might be used to gain access to other hosts, but not usually via the same trojan mechanism.
        <p>
        Back Orifice is an example of a trojan program. It provided legitimate functionality as a remote administration tool, but other functionality made it less suited for this legitimate role. The Back Orifice server program can hide itself from cursory inspections of the system and can even be installed without the user's permission.</p>
        <p>
        Another vector prevalent today is through anti-virus programs on the web. A person visits a web site, and a pop-up window indicates they have 17 different types of spyware/viruses on their computer. If the user then downloads the program to eliminate the malware, he or she has now installed a different malware program! The initial windows that the user sees is in all likelihood just making up results to get the user to download the program.
    </p>
    To see a concrete example of a Trojan Horse, go check out your personal <span id="courseNumber" class="courseNumber">SY110</span> web page (recall: http://midn.cyber.usna.edu/~m2xxxxx/index.html). You included a Javascript script that served the <em>really useful</em> function of displaying the HTML code in the body of your web page. However, hidden inside that script is a "logic bomb", a piece of code which, when the right conditions are satisfied, will suddenly change the behavior of the program to do something bad.  (If you do a view Source on your personal page and then click on the link for the Trojan Horse Javascript, you should be able to discover the logic bomb!)

    Your machine could become a <em>zombie</em>, i.e. a host that's owned (in the sense of being able to give it commands as administrator) by a bad guy and, at his bidding, might be used to do bad things like send spam or
    participate in a DDoS attack. Collections of zombies with a single master are often called <em>botnets</em>.  There are large botnets out there of hundreds of thousands of hosts, whose services are for sale. Malware often uses the Internet to communicate with a <em>command and control</em> host from which it receives instructions on what to do next.  Zombie hosts may simply be waiting for a signal from the command and control host.
    
    <p> Check out <a href="../../2006/11/botnet/index.htm?pg=1&topic=botnet&topic_set="><em>Attack of the Bots</em>, Wired Magazine, 2006</a>.  It's a bit old (2006) but is, in typical Wired fashion, a very nicely written, engaging account of a botnet attack.  Botnets are a serious problem, posing a threat not only to businesses, but even to governments.

    Your machine may become a springboard for a larger attack against the system you are a part of.  Once again, there may be a command and control host sending instruction as to what
    to do next.

    Programs that violate <em>confidentiality</em> might be installed, like <em>keyloggers</em> which capture what you type (or more generally what you click on or see on the screen).  The Malware could even turn on your computer's webcam unbeknownst to you and get a video feed!

       <b>Spyware and Adware</b> <br>
        Spyware is software that is secretly installed onto a computer with the express intent of gathering information on individuals or organizations without their knowledge. This type of malware is commonly associated with identity theft, software based keylogging, or "spying" on another user's activities in the digital realm (<a href="http://www.legalzoom.com/crime-criminals/white-collar-crime/loverspy-program" target="_blank">Loverspy</a>). HTTP cookies may be used for spying, but unlike a cookie, spyware is an executable program. 
    <p>
    Adware is <em>ad</em>vertising-supported soft<em>ware</em> used to generate revenue for its author. Adware is any software package which automatically plays, displays, or downloads advertisements to a computer. These ads can be in the form of a pop-up and/or may change settings on a computer such as a browser homepage. Adware, by itself, is harmless; however, some adware may come with integrated spyware such as a keylogger.

      <h2>Duqu: a mini case study</h2>
      One instance of Malware that has recently come to light is known as <em>Duqu</em>. Taking a little closer look at it is worthwhile because it illustrates a few points from this lesson along with connections to prior lessons. First off, there have been several Duqu attacks. We're talking about one of them. An interesting feature is that they each appear to have been somewhat customized to their target.
    
      <ol class="inst">
  <li>
    <b>Getting a foot in the door</b><br>
    Duqu was initiated with a spearphishing attack: an e-mail to a company employee requesting more information with, in particular, the line "In the attached file, please see a list of requests."  The "attached file" was an innocuous-looking Microsoft Word document.  Opening up that Word document is what started all the trouble.  In this we see why malware offers a different approach to attacking: the user actually opened the door and let the attacker in when he opened that e-mail.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The exploit: executing shell-code with administrator privileges</b><br>
    So how could simply viewing a Word document cause problems? Well, the Word document sent in this attack contained an "embedded font", meaning that the file contained within in it a block of bytes that defined what the characters used in the document should look like when displayed.  The bytes that comprise the font definition are read in and processed by OS code that runs with administrator privileges.  The font definition was actually badly formed in such a way as to trick this OS code into executing shell code (which was also part of the badly formed font definition) which, because it was executed by the OS code, ran with the highest possible privileges. This shell code installed the Duqu malware, which then was up and running long-term on the host, regardless of whether the Word document or Word itself remained open.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Once established, what did it do?</b><br>
    The motives of the attackers using Duqu have not been publicly reported.  But some of the activities of the malware, if not the reasons for the activities, have been disclosed. Duqu contacted a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server to receive instructions.  In fact, the communication between C&amp;C and the infected machine was done over HTTP and HTTPS. At least one Duqu C&amp;C server, though not the one in the attack we're describing, was traced to a machine in Belgium at IP address 77.241.93.160.  The C&amp;C server loaded an extra module (piece of code) on the infected host that allowed it to attack another machine on the same network, making use of that local network access.  Yet another module loaded onto the infected host by the C&amp;C server was a key logger, which logged keystrokes and grabbed screen captures.
  </li>
      </ol>

    <div class="fleet" style="clear: right;">
      <h1>Malware as a Weapon</h1><br>
      Malware has actually been used as an alternative to physical ("kinetic") attacks.  In particular, as was related in a June 1 <a href="../../2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html?pagewanted=all" target="blank">NY Times article</a>, the U.S. and Israel cooperated to produce malware dubbed "Stuxnet", which was designed to cripple the Iranian nuclear weapons program.  The article claims that one of the motivations for the U.S. in creating Stuxnet was to dissuade Israel from carrying out a physical attack. Was the U.S. also responsible for the Flame malware? Duqu?
    
      <p>There are serious ethical, legal, and policy questions surrounding the use of offensive "cyber weapons".  With the revelation that the U.S. has created and used such a weapon, the debate around these questions has become more urgent. Your are taking or will take courses here at USNA about ethics, policy and even law.  Keep these questions about the use of cyber weapons in mind as you take these other courses.

              Recovery is the final step in the process of moving back to a functional computing environment. Keep the following in mind as you proceed.
        
              <ul>
    <li>Contact the IT Department or network administrator if available.</li>
    <li>Disconnect the computer from the network. This will prevent the sending of personal information back to the attacker, and will also prevent the propagation of a worm.</li>
    <li>Backup your important files. You should do this at periodic intervals. This is like car insurance. You want it there if you ever need it, but you hope you never need it.</li>
    <li>Scan your machine for malware with an anti-virus/anti-malware solution. It is best to use a <em>recovery</em> cd from the anti-virus company or your operating system disk. You should treat the operating system, programs, and files as if they are infected.</li>
    <li>Use a web-based scanning solution, such as Microsoft PC Protection Scan.</li>
    <li>To achieve the best results, it may be necessary to start windows in Safe Mode (typically press F8 on startup). Safe Mode will prevent programs from automatically starting. You can also reinstall your anti-virus solution and perform a scan.</li>
    <li>As a last resort, you can always format the hard drive. Unless you are good friends with a computer forensics analyst, you will lose all of your programs and data. Once formatted, you will reinstall your operating
      system, and start over again.  Make sure to properly configure your security settings!</li>
    <li>Always connect your computer back to the network as a last step. This helps protect everyone!</li>
