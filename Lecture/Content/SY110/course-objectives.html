			<ol>
				<li><strong>Explain</strong> why the Cyber Domain is important to the Navy, a Junior Officer, and an individual.</li>
				<li><strong>Describe</strong> computers, operating systems, networks, the Internet and the Web with respect to: digital representations of information, their basic operation and associated tools, and the underlying architectures and protocols and how they may be vulnerable to attack.</li>
				<li><strong>Analyze</strong> and <strong>explain</strong> the output of programs and the results of shell commands and <strong>infer</strong> why certain actions are permitted or not in an information system.</li>
				<li><strong>Identify</strong> and <strong>describe</strong> the principles and desired properties of defensible information systems, and the techniques and tools that are used to provide them. <strong>Explain</strong> representative attacks and their prevention and mitigation measures.</li>
				<li><strong>Explain</strong>, <strong>differentiate</strong>, and <strong>perform</strong> basic actions related to reconnaissance, attack, defense, and forensics of information systems.</li>
				<li><strong>Describe</strong> cyber domain scenarios in which user decisions affect security, <strong>identifying</strong> the user&#39;s versus the technology&#39;s responsibilities, and <strong>explain</strong> the consequences of potential user actions in terms of risk and the tradeoff between services and security.</li>
