			<h2>Cyber Security Tools Learning Objectives.</H2>
    The second portion of the course introduces a few broad categories of tools,
    e.g., firewalls, encryption, and hashing, that we combine in different ways to provide the Pillars of Cyber Security. Such
    a framework allows students to make principled decisions about security<!-- based on risk factors -->. Specific objectives are:
    <ol>
      <BR>
      <li>Firewalls.<BR><BR>
          <ol type="a">
            <li><STRONG>Design</STRONG> an access control list (ACL) for an idealized router to achieve a desired offering of services.</li><BR>
            <li><STRONG>Relate</STRONG> use of a firewall to the Pillars of Cyber Security.</li><BR>
            <li><STRONG>Describe</STRONG> a firewall's role in implementing decisions concerning trade offs between service and security.</li>
          </ol>
          <BR>
      </li>

      <li>Authentication and Cryptography.<BR><BR>
          <ol type="a">
            <li><STRONG>Describe</STRONG> and <STRONG>contrast</STRONG> symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption and hashing and <STRONG>explain</STRONG>
                their roles in providing the Pillars of Cyber Security.<BR><BR></li>
            <li><STRONG>Describe</STRONG> and <STRONG>contrast</STRONG> key management for symmetric and asymmetric encryption.<BR><BR></li>
            <li><STRONG>Explain</STRONG> and actually <STRONG>use</STRONG> representative symmetric encryption and hashing techniques that
                are done "by hand" (e.g., Vigenere Cipher, Rubik's Hash).<BR><BR></li>
            <li><STRONG>Identify</STRONG> the user's vs. the technology's responsibilities in situations where cryptography is used
                (e.g., HTTPS).<BR><BR></li>
            <li><STRONG>Describe</STRONG> common tools such as AES and MD5, <STRONG>relate</STRONG> their use to Cyber Security,
                and <STRONG>demonstrate</STRONG> their use.</li><BR>
            <li><STRONG>Discuss</STRONG> authentication by password, password attacks, hashing, salt, and password strength.</li><BR>
            <li><STRONG>Discuss</STRONG> two-factor authentication.</li><BR>
            <li><STRONG>Explain</STRONG> the workings of attacks such as frequency analysis, chosen plain text, and man-in-the-middle.</li><BR>
            <li><STRONG>Describe</STRONG> the purpose of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and how it works; <STRONG>relate</STRONG> PKI to
                man-in-the-middle attacks.</li><BR>
            <li><STRONG>Obtain</STRONG> an X.509 Certificate from a Certificate Authority. <STRONG>Explain</STRONG> the guarantee that comes
                with a valid certificate, <STRONG>describe</STRONG> reasons a certificate may be invalid, and how user actions
                with respect to certificates can affect security.</li>
						<LI>Describe steganography and explain what information steganography is intended to keep confidential.</LI>
						<LI>Explain simple exemplar steganography techniques.</LI>
          </ol>
        </LI>
        <LI>Risk<BR><BR>
        	<OL>
        		<LI>Explain what a formalized risk assessment process supports/allows.</LI>
        		<LI>Describe the general steps of a risk assessment process.</LI>
        		<LI>Explain the factors of assessing risks.</LI>
        		<LI>Apply the risk assessment process to cyber domain scenarios.</LI>
