    <h3>Policy vs. Law</h3>
    <p>Our government operates through the implementation of policies and laws, but many people aren't entirely sure what the difference between the two are.
    A <b>policy</b> outlines what a government hopes to achieve as well as the methods and principles it will use to achieve them. In other words it's <em><b>"the set of
    actions the government should take in order to reach its desired outcome"</b></em>. The <em>DoD Cyber Objectives and Strategic Goals</em>, which we'll learn about
    later in this lesson, are policies set in place by the Department of Defense. <b>Laws</b> on the other hand are <em><b>"the constitutional, statutory, and regulatory
    authorities set for accomplishing the goals of a policy, as well as limiting or constraining what the goal can be or how the policy can achieve the goal"</b></em>. Laws are
    the standards, procedures, and principles that must be followed by those whom they apply to.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Cyber Laws</h3>
    <p>This list is not exhaustive and as issues arise lawmakers will amend old laws or create new laws to combat the problems we face in the cyber
    domain.</p>
    <h4>Anti-Hacking Laws</h4>
    <ul>
    <li><b><a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/97-1025.pdf">Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)</a></b>: is the primary federal anti-hacking law.
    The federal government can bring criminal actions against people who violate the CFAA, and victims of computer hacking can sue the attackers.</li>
    <p>There are 7 types of violations under the CFAA:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Accessing a computer to commit espionage, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(1)</li>
    <li>Computer trespassing resulting in exposure to certain governmental, credit, financial, or computer-housed information, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(2);</li>
    <li>Computer trespassing in a government computer, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(3);</li>
    <li>Committing fraud an integral part of which involves unauthorized access to a government computer, a bank computer, or a computer used in,
    or affecting, interstate or foreign commerce, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(4);</li>
    <li>Damaging a government computer, a bank computer, or a computer used in, or affecting, interstate or foreign commerce, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(5);</li>
    <li>Trafficking passwords for a government computer, or when the trafficking affects interstate or foreign commerce, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(6);</li>
    <li>Threatening to damage a government computer, a bank computer, or a computer used in, or affecting, interstate or foreign commerce, 18 U.S.C. 1030(a)(7);</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The CFAA isn't without issues. The law was passed in 1984 under very different circumstances when the digital domain barely resembled its
    present day form. There have been a number of legal issues arising over the interpretation and application of the law, especially the "exceeds
    authorized access" wording of the law. Some legal experts have argued that violating the terms of service a website could be considered a criminal
    action even though that was not the intent of lawmakers when they wrote the CFAA. <a href="../../watch-1.html?v=KpYF6X2rOj4">
    Aaron Swartz</a> is a good example of the unintended consequences of the laws and policies we create.</p>
    
    <p>The CFAA also has jurisdictional limits. Even if hackers have been identified and indicted, it is very difficult to bring them to a U.S. court for a
    criminal trial if they are located in a country with which we do not have extradition procedures. So when the Russian hackers of the DNC were
    recently indicted, there was little expectation that they would ever appear in a U.S. courtroom for prosecution, because we do not expect Russia to
    extradite them.</p>
    
    <li><b><a href="../../intellectual-property/103018-expanded-dmca-competition-innovation/index.htm#.XRoHe-hKjIU">Digital Millennium Copyright Act
    (DMCA)</a></b>: is a 1998 amendment to the Copyright Act of 1976 which was intended to protect copyrighted works. Section 1201 of the Act
    prohibits circumventing a “technological measure that effectively controls access” to copyrighted works. Unfortunately this section is so generally
    worded that it criminalizes research into vulnerabilities by white hat hackers, the good guys who will tell you about the vulnerabilities
    rather than exploit them. As a result many vulnerabilities are left to be found by our adversaries because white hat hackers fear being prosecuted.</li>
    <p>Furthermore, the Librarian of Congress's decision to not renew an exception for "jail-breaking" a cell phone temporarily made every person who
    had done so into a criminal prosecutable under DMCA Section 1201. Congress reinstated the exception and made sure that no one was
    prosecuted.</p>  
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Private Sector Data Security Regulations</h4>
    
    <ul>
    <li><b>State and Federal Regulations</b>: Private sector data security is regulated by a wide range of state and federal laws in the U.S. There is not
    a settled list of requirements for companies. Rather, regulators and courts will look at whether their cyber-security safeguards were “reasonable,”
    which is a subjective sliding scale and the decisions made by one court may not match the decisions made by another.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b><a href="../../datasecurity.html">Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act</a></b>: prohibits unfair and deceptive trade
    practices. The FTC has interpreted this to mean poor or misrepresented data security, and has brought enforcement actions against companies after
    data breaches. Below is a list of some well known companies that the FTC has implemented oversight and enforcement actions upon:
    </li>
    <br>
    <ol>
    <li><a href="../../enforcement/cases-proceedings/162-3102/paypal-inc-matter.html">PayPal</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../enforcement/cases-proceedings/152-3054/uber-technologies-inc.html">Uber</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../enforcement/cases-proceedings/132-3078/snapchat-inc-matter.html">Snapchat</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../enforcement/cases-proceedings/152-3284/ashley-madison.html">Ashley Madison</a></li>
    <li><a href="../../enforcement/cases-proceedings/1023142-x120032/wyndham-worldwide-corporation.html">Wyndham</a></li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <li><b>State Data Breach Notification Laws</b>: Every state requires companies to notify individuals and/or state regulators of a data breach. These laws
    all differ as to the type of information that triggers the obligation as well as the particular type of notification the companies must issue. For small
    companies that don't have money for a legal team navigating state data breach laws can be a nightmare since the data breach doesn't have to have
    occurred in the state it simply has to have affected a resident of the state.</li>
    <p>A summary of State Data Breach Notification laws can be found <a href="../../en/insights/publications/2019/01/state-data-breach-notification-laws.html">here</a>
    and a chart with the rules of each state can be found
    <a href="../../-/media/files/insights/publications/2019/05/18mc12803-data-breach-chart-052019-v2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Twelve states also have laws that require companies to apply reasonable data security for their resident's personal information. The most detailed
    of the requirements is <a href="../../files/documents/2017/10/02/201cmr17.pdf">Massachusetts</a>.</p>
    
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Posse Comitatus</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/95-964.pdf">Posse Comitatus Act</a> prohibits the use of the military to enforce domestic civilian
    laws absent an exception created by Congress. This does not mean that the military can’t provide assistance in defending networks. It just can’t act
    as the police in arresting/assisting the prosecution. In fact, in April of 2016 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended that the DoD
    created more clearly defined roles and responsibilities for assisting civil authorities with cyber incidents implying that the military was not meeting
    expectations to provide defense, recovery, and investigations services in some cases.</p>
    
    
    <h3>Agencies Responsible for Cyber Security</h3>
    <p>The U.S. does not have a single agency that is responsible for cyber-security, but <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/marketing/Cybersecurity/2013march21_cyberroleschart.authcheckdam.pdf">
    this bubble chart</a> provides the best breakdown.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><b>Department of Defense (DoD)</b>: we'll discuss this a little later on in this lesson in the DoD Cyber Objectives and Strategies section.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Department of Homeland Security (DHS)</b>: Responsible for cyber-security of civilian federal networks, systems, and information, protecting
    critical infrastructure, and assisting with cyber-security of the U.S. private sector and running the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team
    (U.S.-CERT) for information sharing.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Department of Justice (DoJ)</b>: Responsible for investigating, attributing, disrupting, and prosecuting violations of federal computer crime laws.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber-security Framework</h3>
    <p>NIST is a non-regulatory agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce whose mission is to promote innovation and industrial competitiveness. NIST
    has created an advisory framework found on their <a href="../../cyberframework.html"> website</a> that consists of standards,
    guidelines, and best practices to manage cyber-security-related risk. It's a relatively simple framework with only 5 components:</p>

    <h3>DoD Cyber Objectives and Strategic Goals</h3>
    
    <h4>Objectives</h4>
    <p>The <a href="../../2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF">2018 DoD Cyber Strategy</a>
    declares the DoD's objectives and strategic goals in cyberspace. The document states that the DoD cyberspace objectives:
    <ol>
    <li>Ensuring the Joint Force can achieve its missions in a contested cyberspace environment.</li>
    <li>Strengthening the Joint Force by conducting cyberspace operations that enhance U.S. military advantages</li>
    <li>Defending U.S. critical infrastructure from malicious cyber activity that alone, or as part of a campaign, could cause a significant cyber incident.</li>
    <li>Securing DoD information and systems against malicious cyber activity, including DoD information on non-DoD-owned networks.</li>
    <li>Expanding DoD cyber cooperation with inter-agency, industry, and international partners.</li>
    </ol>
    This is what many of your civilian NSA and military Information Warfare Community instructors did before coming to teach at the academy.
    
    <h4>Strategic Goals</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Build a more lethal Joint Force.</li>
    <li>Compete and Deter in Cyberspace.</li>
    <li>Strengthen alliances and attract new partnerships.</li>
    <li>Reform the Department.</li>
    <li>Cultivate talent.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The policies, laws, and organizations that govern the cyber domain in the U.S. are complicated and are bound to become more complicated as new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and drones are perfected and widely used. The laws and policies that protect and govern us are just as important as the defenders that protect our networks and the attackers that ensure our success in military operations against our adversaries.</p>
