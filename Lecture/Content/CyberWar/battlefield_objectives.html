			<H2>Cyber Battlefield Learning Outcomes</H2>
			<P>
				The first portion of the course begins with an introduction to the theoretical underpinnings of cyber security, then continues with an introduction to the basic components of "cyberspace". We start with digital data, the physical computer, operating systems and programs, and continue to the Web, the Internet, and both wired and wireless networks. These components comprise the basic physical systems, data and protocols that are the building blocks of cyberspace.
