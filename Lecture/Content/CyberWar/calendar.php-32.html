    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>
    After completing these activities you should be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify U.S. adversaries</li>
      <li>Identify U.S. adversary capabilities</li>
      <li>Describe the importance of the cyber domain in modern warfare</li>
      <li>Explain how the cyber domain impacts members of the Unrestricted Line Communities</li>
      <li>Identify and describe the key cyber enabling organizations in the United States Navy</li>
      <li>Identify and describe the 4 officer designators in the Information Warfare Community</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
  This lesson has two primary goals. First, we will seek to identify actors working against the United States in the cyber domain. Then, we will learn how the Navy is combatting these adversaries.
  </p>
  <p> 
  Although the United States is not at war with any country (even as it fights terrorists), the line between war and peace in cyberspace is fuzzy. Many countries carry out acts in cyberspace that they would not carry out in the physical world because it is difficult to attribute them to any single enemy and therefore there is a smaller chance of a Kinetic retaliation. The struggle between the United States and these potential adversaries in cyberspace is ongoing and continuous. Cyberspace has no front lines. Thus, as future military officers - indeed as midshipmen - you are already engaged in this struggle.
  </p>

  <h2>Attackers</h2>    
    <p>
    The range of adversaries is vast. It includes the four countries which we'll focus on: Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. But other unfriendly countries, some friendly countries, organized criminal groups, politically-motivated groups, individuals, and even unfortunately, rogue colleagues cannot be ignored.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <p><li>
      <b>Russia</b>: the country left-over from the Soviet Union is probably the most formidable foe of the United States in cyberspace. Russia is trying to revise the world order and thereby regain the status it had in the Cold War when it was the world's other great superpower.
      </li></p>
      <p>
      Russia's challenge is both broad and deep, encompassing cyber-attack (disruption and corruption) and cyber-espionage (spying) the results of which are often to feed their propaganda. Its rich supply of cyber warriors arises from the country's long-term focus on intelligence operations (dating back to the 19th century) coupled with the high quality of its mathematics education and the scarcity of alternative legitimate high-technology employment in its economy. In short, their hackers are very good, even though the country is struggling economically.
      </p>
      <p>
      Russian hackers have penetrated many institutions ranging from NATO and the <a href="../../sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/01/589787931/russias-fancy-bear-reportedly-hacks-german-government-networks.html">German Parliament</a> to the U.S. State Department, the mail system of the U.S. Joint Staff, and even (it is believed) the SIPRNet, the network that DoD uses to handle its military secrets. For the most part, they steal information in order to better understand U.S. strengths, weaknesses, and plans. In 2016, however, Russia penetrated networks associated with a U.S. political party and posted the results in an effort to sway the U.S. Presidential Election or at least reduce the public's faith in its political process. The U.S. intelligence community believes that Russia will try to do something similar in future elections.
      </p>
      <p>
      Russia is also believed to have carried out, or at least inserted malware for, cyber-attacks on the U.S. critical infrastructure. Over the last several years Russian hackers have cut the <a href="../../story/russian-hackers-attack-ukraine/index.htm"> power flows in Ukraine</a>, a country struggling with Russia-supported separatists. Russian malware has been found in U.S.power station control rooms.  Most recently, the intelligence community believes that Russian hackers have penetrated the U.S. electric grid, leaving malware behind.
      </p>
      
      
    
      <p><li>
      <b>China</b>: The Chinese threat is largely in the form of cyber-espionage, although that could change quickly in a crisis. <a href="../../Portals/27/Documents/News/Military Power Publications/China_Military_Power_FINAL_5MB_20190103.pdf">Chinese military doctrine</a> emphasizes the use of cyber-attack on opposing military forces as a way to gain and seize the battlefield initiative. Anyone going in harm's way where Chinese forces are involved should be aware of the risks to their systems in doing so (even if no shots are exchanged).
      </li></p>
      Chinese operations in cyberspace are motivated in large part by the country's intense desire to become the world's dominant power as they were for centuries before roughly 1820. To foster their technological growth, Chinese spies have <a href="../../magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2170132/how-chinas-rampant-intellectual-property-theft.html">stolen large quantities of technical information from corporations in the United States</a>, U.S. allies, and even from the Russians. Chinese spies are also interested in military secrets, notably having stolen massive amounts of highly sensitive data related to undersea warfare including secret plans to develop a supersonic anti-ship missile for use on U.S. submarines by 2020. The Chinese are also interested in spying on the national security establishments of their neighbors (particularly in Southeast Asia) following years of having spied on dissident groups (e.g., Tibetans).
      
      <p>
      Chinese hackers, at this point, are not considered as good as individual Russian hackers, but they are improving rapidly, and there are many of them. The Chinese threat will persist even if U.S. relationship with China continues to remain on an even keel.
      </p>
      
     
      <p><li>
      <b>Iran</b>: Although a regional power only, the complexities of Middle East politics have led to many direct confrontations between the United States and Iran, which have shown up in cyberspace as well as the physical world.
      </li></p>
      <p>
      Although Iran is not as sophisticated as Russia and China, their hackers have demonstrated considerable technical competence and thus cannot be ignored. Several years ago, they breached the <a href="../../articles/us-says-iran-hacked-navy-computers-1380314771.html">Navy-Marine Corps Internet</a> (from whence Operation Rolling Tide) and also carried out cyber-attacks that flooded web sites in ways that prevented customers from accessing U.S. banks online. They have also carried out cyber-attacks that have wiped the contents from thousands of computers at one time: victims included Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and a U.S. gaming corporation. More recent penetrations <a href="../../article/us-usa-iran-cyber/u-s-indicts-iranians-for-hacking-dozens-of-banks-new-york-dam-idUSKCN0WQ1JF.html">compromised the controls of a U.S. dam</a>, and the safety systems of several Middle East facilities.
      </p>
      
    
      <p><li>
      <b>North Korea</b>: In 2014, Sony pictures suffered the <a href="../../newshour/nation/north-korean-programmer-charged-in-sony-hack-wannacry-attack.html"></a>regime's wrath when it made a movie about the country's leader: as a result, thousands of computers were trashed, several films uploaded to the Internet, and sensitive e-mails of corporate executives were released to the public. This followed a series of cyber-attacks (<a href="../../2014/12/the-case-for-n-koreas-role-in-sony-hack/index.htm#more-29249">Dark Seoul</a>) against media and financial companies is South Korea that were far costlier. Several years afterwards North Korean hackers managed to penetrate nuclear power plants and urban mass transit systems in the country. Although most of North Korea's cyberspace operations have been directed against South Korea, because the United States maintains forces there, it would not take long for cyberspace operations against this U.S. ally to spill over into U.S. networks or to affect allied operations.
      </li></p>
      <p>
      In recent years, North Korea's hackers have turned to crime.  Several years ago, they stole over $80 million from the <a href="../../news/articles/2018-10-08/north-korea-hackers-broke-into-banks-tried-to-take-1-1-billion.html">national bank of Bangladesh</a>. More recently, they released ransomware that paralyzed several institutions, notably Britain's National Health Service.
      </p>
      <p>
      North Korean hackers are not considered elite, but, they too, are improving, in part under Chinese tutelage. Their successes demonstrates that a country does not have to be filled with genius hackers to cause others trouble.
      </p>
      

      <p><li>
      <b>Terrorists</b>: The term cyber-terrorist, is evidence that just because there is a word for something, that something might not actually exist (see unicorn) or at least not quite yet. Many prior incidents originally ascribed to the terrorist group, ISIS, such as the hack of CENTCOM's twitter feed or the hijacking of <a href="../../news/french-tv-network-tv5-monde-hacked-by-cybercaliphate-in-name-of-isis/index.htm">France's TV5</a> are now believed to be the work of Russians masquerading as ISIS. Although there undoubtedly are terrorists that would like to hurt Americans in cyberspace as they would in physical space, the results of a cyber-attack rarely make as good video as the results of a physical attack, and it takes scarce talent to do it well. That said, terrorists are only a few recruits away from becoming a serious threat.
      </li></p>
      
    </ul>

    <p>
    This list is not and cannot be exhaustive. Any country can switch from being a friend to a foe: Iran was a friend in 1977 under the shah and a foe in  1979 under the mullahs. And even friendly countries may carry out cyber-espionage against U.S. interests just as friendly countries (e.g., Israel) have used spies (e.g., Jonathan Pollard) against the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
    Criminal groups pose their own threat. Most of the time they want money or some asset of yours (such as personal details) that they can leverage into money by selling it to identity thieves.  Most of them are unaffiliated with governments.  But there are exceptions.  Many Russian so-called cyber-mafia have close ties to Russia's intelligence agencies and similar ties exist in Iran.
    </p>

  <h2>Defenders</h2>  
    <p>
    Now we will discuss how the Navy responds to the various cyber threats posed by all the attackers listed above. Also, we discuss the key cyber organizations in the Department of Defense and United States Navy, to include the Navy&#39;s Information Warfare Community (IWC), it&#39;s various sub-communities, and their relevant organizations and missions. At the end of this lesson we hope you have a greater understanding of how cyber will impact you no matter what path you choose for your career.

    <h3>Information Warfare Community</h3>

      <p>
      So who exactly is responsible for defending against adversaries in the Cyber Domain? The answer is no &ndash; the Navy has an entire community that operates in this domain performing a variety of important functions in support of the Fleet. The Information Warfare Community (IWC) is composed of four communities that effectively and collaboratively lead and manage a cadre of officers, enlisted, and civilian professionals who possess extensive skills in information intensive fields. This community of professionals receives extensive training, education, and work experience in information, intelligence, counter-intelligence, human-derived information, networks, space, and oceanographic disciplines. The IWC continuously develops and delivers dominant information capabilities in support of U.S. Navy, joint, and national war fighting requirements.

    <h3>Unrestricted Line Communities</h3>
    
      <p>
      The Naval Academy&#39;s goal is to have 95% of its graduating class pursue a career in one of the Navy&#39;s unrestricted line communities.   An unrestricted line officer (URL officer) is a commissioned officer who is qualified (eligible) for command at sea of a Navy war fighting unit. These officers include: Surface Warfare (111X), Submarine Warfare (112X), Naval Aviation (Pilot-131X and Naval Flight Officer (NFO-132X)), Special Warfare (SEAL-113X), and Special Operations Officers (Diver, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD-114X)). In the next section we will look at how cyber impacts each of these communities. (Note: X is replaced with a 0 for Active Duty; 5 for Reservist)
      </p>

      <p>
      The Surface and Submarine Warfare communities have benefited from technology improvements in their navigation, administrative, logistics, engineering, operations, and combat system networks. The same is also true with the Aviation Warfare community, both Navy and Marine Corps, and the advanced avionics, propulsion, weapons, and sensor systems found in modern air platforms. At first glance you might not realize the importance of the Cyber Domain to the Navy Special Warfare and Marine Ground communities, but try to imagine one of these traditionally ground based units deployed with no communications equipment. <b>The reality of modern warfighting is that no community has been left untouched by the Cyber Domain.</b>

          <li>
          Electromagnetic Spectrum Management - Electronic warfare involves controlling the electromagnetic spectrum.  Submarines are equipped to maximize <b>availability</b> but also train to operate in denied environments.  A coordinated effort between fast attack submarines and satellite systems perform Electronic Protection (EP) and Electronic Warfare Support (ES) in a variety of operating environments.
          </li>
          <li>
          Maintaining Shipboard TS/SCI Networks -  Submarines maintain extremely classified local area networks.  Fast-Attack submarines (Los Angeles Class, Seawolf class, and Virginia class) are loaded with Top Secret networks in support of certain missions.  Maintaining the <b>integrity</b> of these networks is paramount to keeping submarine operations secure.
          </li>
          <li>
          OPSEC/Social Media Concerns - Due to the covert nature of submarine missions, the <b>confidentiality</b> of operating schedules cannot be overstressed.  The secrecy of Ballistic Missile submarine (Ohio class) schedules allow us to maintain a second-strike nuclear capability.  Social media and human factors that have evolved from cyberspace development raises new challenges in this area.
          </li>
          <li>
          Rapid & Accurate Message Authentication -  As submarines need to receive all external communications during limited communication windows, a process for the rapid and accurate <b>authentication</b> of received messages is critical.  Ballistic missile submarines must have a full-proof means to ensure that launch orders originate from National Command Authority (non-repudiation).
          </li>
