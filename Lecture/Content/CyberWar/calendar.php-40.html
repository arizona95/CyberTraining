      <ul>
      <li>In this lesson, we look at cryptographic <em>hashes</em>, which are tools for guaranteeing information <b><a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#I">integrity</a></b>.</li>
      <li><b><a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#H">Hashes</a></b> are used in a variety of ways, including password <b><a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#A">authentication</a></b>, which we'll talk a bit about below. </li>
      <li>Hashes allow us to check the integrity of a message, i.e. check that the message has not been tampered with, even without a copy of the "original" message. In the setting of passwords, this means that <u>we can check a password without ever storing a copy of the password</u>, which is important for security.</li>
      <li>Thus, even though what <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#H">hashing</a> provides directly is a way to check integrity, it can actually be used to help support <b>authentication</b>, as well. In fact, hashing is also used to help provide <b><a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#N">non-repudiation</a></b>.</li>

      <h2>Hashes</h2>
      
      <div id="hashes">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Example: a Prediction</b>. Suppose you wanted to prove to someone &mdash; but someone you dislike &mdash; that you are psychic. You might, for example, predict the winner of next season's The Voice. If you give him your prediction now, he might place a bet and make a lot of money, which is bad because you dislike him.  On the other hand, if you give him your prediction after the season, he won't believe you're psychic.
      
    <li>What you need is to give him something beforehand, something that:
      <ol>
        <li>gives no information before or during the season about your prediction
        <li>after the season provides indisputable evidence that you predicted the real winner (or, if you failed, that you didn't).
      </li></ol>
      
      <div class="annotation noInst">
        It's worth thinking a bit about this example.  Hashing will provide a guarantee before hand of the <em>integrity</em> of the message you'll send afterwards.  <em>Integrity</em>, one of the Pillars of Cyber Security! 
      </div>
      
    <li>Essentially, what we need is something that will guarantee that you haven't modified the message since before the The Voice season started. There is a cryptographic technique called <em>hashing</em>   that provides this "something", this guarantee of integrity.
  </li></ul>
      </div>
      
    <p class="sec"><h2>Rubik's Hash: An Analogy to <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#H">Hash Functions</a></h2>
      
      
      <ul>
  <div id="rubics1">
    <li><b>How It Works</b>. Here's a simple scheme would allow us to prove our psychic-ness. At the right you see a table with some letters and punctuation marks.  Next to each of them is a sequence of two colored squares. We write down the name of the predicted winner, and we replace each character with the squares from its table entry. Then, we take an solved Rubik's Cube and go through the      sequence of squares in order, interpreting each square as a quarter-turn clockwise twist of the cube-face with that color as its center square. When we're done, we give the messed up Rubik's cube to "the guy". <u>The messed up Rubik's Cube is the <em>hash</em> of the predicted winner's name</u>.
      
    <li><b>Proving it Later</b>. Once the season is over, we give "the guy" the name of the winner we predicted, and he can take a second solved Rubik's cube, go through the moves for that input, and verify that what he gets is the same as the Rubik's cube you gave him.
      
    <li>Barring some incredibly unlikely coincidence, no two people would have names that hash to the same value, so "the guy" will be convinced that the message (just a name) you gave him after the fact is the same as the message you had hashed beforehand, and thus he will be convinced that you are really psychic. <u>Hashing like this guarantees the integrity of your prediction</u>. If you had predicted incorrectly, the hash value of your prediction would be a complete mismatch from the confirmation hash value later.
  </li></div>
  
         <div class="annotation">You might object that for some people (and    certainly for <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#C">computers</a>) solving Rubik's Cube is easy. We can address this in two ways: we could use a Rubik's 4-cube, 5-cube or 6-cube to up the difficulty, or we could (complicate the algorithm for the) hash by running through the input forward then backward. Our Rubik's Cube Hash example is just an analogy, though. The key is defining a mathematical function that (among other things), is <b>easy to compute in the forward direction (given input, produce output), but far more difficult to compute in reverse (given output, produce input).</b> Real-world hash functions are far more difficult to compute in reverse (i.e., "solve") than our Rubik's Cube, but the analogy holds: it's easy to compute the cube configuration given an input (sequence of moves), but more difficult, given a cube configuration, to deduce exactly which moves produced that configuration.</div>
  
         <div class="annotation" style="clear: right;"><b>How many moves to solve a Rubik's cube?</b><br>A group of researchers, using computer time donated to them by Google, proved that the least number of moves that suffices to solve any scrambled cube is 20. Read <a href="../../index-24.htm">the details</a>.</div>
  
         <div class="annotation" style="clear: right;">Can you solve a Rubik's cube while juggling?<br><iframe width="300" height="215" src="../../embed/zAIPL5O9Uwk.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
  
  <div id="rubics2">
    <li>What about our goal of not giving away the name of our predicted winner prior to the end of the season? Well, finding a input that hashes to the mixed up cube you gave "the guy" means solving a Rubik's Cube, and that's hard! This is the fundamental insight behind hashing: <b>it's easy to produce a hash from an input (a sequence of <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#B">bytes</a>), but very hard, given a hash, to find the input that produced it</b>. Not impossible, just hard to do fast &mdash; like solving a Rubik's Cube, which is not impossible, just hard to do fast.  In this case, finding "a" input that hashes to the same cube isn't enough, because you might find a different input (probably not a person's name) that just happens to hash to the same value.
  </li></div>
  
      </ul>
      
      
    <p class="sec"><h2><a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#S">Salt</a>: Strengthening Hash Functions</h2>
      
      <div id="salt">
  <ul>
    
    <li>As the The Voice season progresses, the field of contestants gets small enough that "the guy", if he has lots of time or has lots of friends (and Rubik's cubes) helping him, could figure out the name of the predicted winner from the hash without having to solve a Rubik's Cube. He could simply get the Rubik's Hash of every  remaining contestant's name and find the one that matches the cube you gave him.  Because there are too few possible messages (contestant names), you risk giving away your prediction to "the guy". This is called a <em><a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#D">dictionary attack</a></em>, by the way. When      the pool of possible inputs that could have produced the hash     value is small enough, one can try them all and test for  matches.  This pool of candidate inputs is the "dictionary".
      
    <li>In situations like this, we can add complexity by <em>salting</em> the input before hashing.  You could, for instance, choose several random letters and add them to the front and the back of the name you've predicted <em>before</em> you actually take the hash. These random letters are the "salt". Now, "the guy" can't try hashing each contestant's name, even when it's down to just a few contestants, because he'd have to try each name with each possible salt value, and there way too many possibilities. After the competition, you present him  with an input like <pre>XOKZPJOHNSMITHXOKZP</pre>  and he can verify that you did indeed predict "John_Smith" to win. <b>Adding "salt" multiplies the effective size of the "dictionary" of possible input values, making an exhaustive ("brute-force") trial of all possible input values less practical.</b>
      
  </li></ul>
      </div>
      
      
    <p class="sec"><h2>Properties of a Good Cryptographic Hash Function</h2><br><br>
      
      There are several properties that a good cryptographic hash function should have.
      
      <div id="properties">
  <ol class="inst">
    
    <li><b>It should be easy to compute the hash of an input</b>.</li>
    
    <li><b>If all you have is a hash value, it should be very hard to find an input that hashes to that value</b>. Our Rubik's Cube Hash has this property (and the first property), at least if you accept Rubik's cube solving as being difficult.
      
    <li><b>It should be difficult to find two inputs with the same hash</b>. Related to that, it should be hard to take a hash value and a input that hashes to it, and engineer from the first input another input that hashes to that same value. It might not be obvious that someone could cause trouble if they could do this, but what should be obvious is that if we can do this, our hashing scheme is not capable of guaranteeing the integrity of messages, and that's bad.

    <p class="sec"><h2>Password Authentication</h2>
      
      <div id="auth">
  <ul>
    
    <li>A very common application of hashing is password checking. Suppose there's a server you login to from time to time. It's undesirable to store your password on the <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#S">server's</a> hard drive.  There are tricks that might allow people to see that <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#F">file</a> and, once they do, they'd have your password and be able to log in as you.  So instead, we'd like the server to store something that it can use to <em>verify</em> your password, but which nobody can use to <em>figure out</em> your password. We can use a hash function!
      
    <li>Servers have a special file (the password file) that stores usernames and the hashes of passwords. When you log in, you give your password, they hash it and check the hash against the entry for your username in the password file stored on their hard drive. 
      
    <li>Because people aren't very creative about choosing passwords,        there is a relatively small pool of likely passwords, which means dictionary attacks are a problem; choosing unlikely passwords reduces this risk. Unfortunately, people have collected huge precomputed lists of passwords and their hash values. These precomputed lists, often stored in a special format called a called <em><a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#R">Rainbow Table</a></em>, can be searched very quickly.  
      
    <li>The effectiveness of Rainbow Table attacks can be reduced by using salt. Typically, a server will store a user's login name, salt input (different for each user, and randomly chosen when the account is created), and the hash of "password+salt". For a rainbow table        to be effective, it has to store the hash value for every possible password+salt combination.  So, using a 10-byte salt, for example, even if there are a million passwords in the pool, there would be        1,208,925,819,614,629,174,706,176,000,000 potential entries in the rainbow table. That's 1.2&times;10<sup>18</sup> terabytes. That size of table is impractical.
      
    <li>Note that salt doesn't help against a brute-force attack of all possible passwords, assuming attacker has the password file, because the attacker therefore also has each user's individual salt value. But <b>salt does slow down a precomputed, dictionary-based attack</b> (such as those employing Rainbow Tables), especially in the common situation where an attacker isn't trying to break into a specific account, but is looking for any account to break into.

      <h2>Strength of passwords</h2>
      
      <ul>There are two scenarios for cracking passwords, <b>online</b> and <b>offline</b> attacks.<br><br>
  
  <li><b>Online Attacks</b>. In this setting, the attacker does not possess a password-hash file, but actually tries to login with many different passwords. Most systems take a long time (in computer terms) to respond to a login &mdash; especially an incorrect login.  This limits the effectiveness of this kind of attack. For instance, if it takes 2 seconds to get a "login failed" message, you can only try 30 passwords a minute. If you had an 8-character password, even if all characters were lowercase letters, if would take on average over 6,000 years to log in successfully in this scenario. Also, unsuccessful login attempts are usually logged, so that even a mildly vigilant system administrator would be aware that someone was attempting to hack into the account after a few minutes of trying.<br>
    
    <div style="float: right; clear: right; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-bottom: 0.5em;"> <a href="../../936/index.htm"><img title="To anyone who understands information theory and security and is in an infuriating argument with someone who does not (possibly involving mixed case), I sincerely apologize." src="../../comics/password_strength.png" height="300pt"></a></div>
    
    <br><br>Many systems employ <b><em>throttling</em>, in which the server starts introducing longer and longer delays as the same user tries more and more logins within a brief period.</b>  In fact, often systems lock an account if there are too many unsuccessful attempts in a short period of time.  With this policy, an attacker couldn't possibly be successful unless he had narrowed down the password to one of a very small number of possibilities. So, in this scenario even a relatively short password will be relatively secure <em>provided it is not easily guessable.</em></li>
    
    <div style="clear: right;" class="news"><b>A Really Bad Password</b>   The worst thing you can do is choose a password that's really common. The <a href="../../2010/01/21/technology/21password.html">RockYou.com breach</a> allows us all to see what some of these are. The five most common passwords of the 32 million that were stolen were:
      <ol>
               <li>123456</li>
               <li>12345</li>
               <li>123456789</li>
               <li>password</li>
               <li>iloveyou</li>
      </ol>
     So if you use one of those, you're making it really easy for people who want to break into your account. Think it doesn't happen? Check out this <a href="../../entry/assad-syria-worlds-worst-password-anonymous-hack_n_1863462.html">Feb 2012 Huffington Post story</a> about how a Syrian official's emails were stolen because his password was <em>12345</em>.<br> Check out this <a href="../../blog/september32012/index.htm">article</a>, which has a fun discussion of popular PINs.
           </div>
         
           <div style="clear: right;" class="news"><b>LinkedIn Hacked ... and they didn't use salt!</b><br>In the summer of 2012, the popular social media site linkedin.com had account information stolen, including password hashes.  Shockingly, this very high-profile site was not salting passwords!  They changed that immediately, of    course, but it was a bit late at that point. The ACM Queue article <a href="../../detail.cfm.html?id=2254400"><em>LinkedIn Password Leak: Salt Their Hide</em></a> has a good discussion of why this is so disastrous!
           </div>
    
    <div style="clear: right;" class="annotation">Number of passwords of length <em>n</em> is k<sup>n</sup>, where <em>k</em> is the number of characters the password came from.  So if you restrict yourself to lowercase letters, there are 26<sup>n</sup> passwords of length n. If you draw from both uppercase and lower case, there are    52<sup>n</sup>. If you draw from both uppercase, lower case and digits 0-9, there are 62<sup>n</sup>.  And so on. However, length is far more important than the size of the character set you draw from.  There are 138,000 times more passwords of length 12 using only lower case, than passwords of length 6 using all possible printable characters.   
         </div>
  <br>  
  <li><b>Offline Attacks</b>. In this scenario, things are a lot more dire, because someone has stolen the password file. Because the attacker has his own copy of the password file, he doesn't have to try logging into a real system to check whether he's found the password.  He simply hashes his guessed password and checks if it matches a hash in the file.  This means he can check millions &mdash; potentially billions &mdash; of passwords per second. 
  
    <br><p>There are three basic attacks here: <b>brute force (try every input of length 1, then 2, then 3 ...)</b>, a <b>dictionary attack</b>, and <b>precomputed (rainbow table) attacks</b>.  Long passwords that include lower and upper case letters, numbers and punctuation characters are most secure.  What's also important is that your password is not a        real word or names and, most of all, don't choose things like <code>iloveyou1</code>, that about a million other people also use as a password.</p>
    
    <p>As we've seen, salting passwords provides some security in the face of an offline attack, since precomputed tables can't be used.  It's also possible to add a site-wide salt value, so that what's actually stored in the password file is the hash of <em>password + user-salt + site-salt</em>. This way an attacker has to steal the <em>site-salt</em> value as well as the password file.  Finally, a site can employ <em>password stretching</em>.  The idea behind     password stretching is to make the computation of a single hash very time-consuming. That way, <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#B">brute force attacks</a> take a whole lot longer.  One way to do this is to store not the hash of the password+salt, but the hash of the hash of the hash of the hash of ... of the hash of the password+salt. If you use the 10,000-times iterated hash, and attacker has to wait 10,000 times longer for a password to be cracked.</p></li>

  <br>
  <li><b>Password Expiration</b>.  <b>In the practice of password expiration, users' passwords will expire after a certain amount of time and they will be required to create a new password.</b>  Many organizations, such as the U.S. Navy and the Naval Academy, employ security policies which require all users to change their passwords after 90 days.  This security practice prevents a hacker from using old user credentials or continuing to exploit a compromised password.</li>
  
  <br>
  <li><b>Key Logger</b>.  Imagine someone breaks into your office and does not steal anything, but installs a piece of hardware or software onto your computer without your knowledge.  Or perhaps you download some well-disguised malware and install it.  That hardware or malware might be a key logger which <b>tracks every keystroke you make and logs it</b>.  Later on, that bad guy could retrieve the data from the key logger and potentially find your password! </li>

        <b>How Apple and Amazon Security Flaws Led to My Epic Hacking</b><br>
        Mat Honan wrote an interesting 
        <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking">article
          in Wired</a> about his digital life getting hacked.  This story
        highlights a number of really important lessons:
        <ol>
          <li><em>security is holistic</em> &mdash; whether Mr. Honan
       chose a strong password, or whether apple used salt &amp;
            hashing didn't matter ... because the protocol apple uses for
            authenticating a person asking for a password to be reset is
            incredibly weak.</li>
       <li><em>security is ... well, it's holistic</em> &mdash;
   Mr. Honan's Twitter account (the goal of the attack) was
   secure enough in isolation, but nothing's isolated.  There
   were connections to other accounts of his, that were
   connected to other accounts, and in the context of all these
   connections, his Twitter account was not secure.
       </li>
          <li>
            <em>you don't have to outrun the bear</em> &mdash;
            Mr. Honan states that, if he'd used two-factor authentication
            for his gmail account, this probably wouldn't have happened.
            Why? Because the attacker would have simply turned to an
            easier target.

    and passwords. This prompts the instructor to turn on hashing of passwords for the message board.  When you go back and steal the password file again, all you found are usernames and hashes-of-passwords. This prompts us to try to <em>crack</em> the hashes to recover the passwords. We have the RockYou.com dictionary of passwords, with precomputed <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#M">MD5</a> hashes for each of them.  This way, we crack many passwords quite quickly. This prompts the instructor to turn on salting of passwords, so the precomputed hashes can't be used. This slows down our attack quite a bit, but still some passwords can be cracked.  Finally, we discuss what makes for secure (hard to crack) passwords. We end up with the following observation: both the server (website) and the client (user) have some responsibilities in protecting identities with passwords.   Here is our summary:

      <h2>Two factor authentication</h2>
      
      <div class="news" style="clear: right;">
       <b>Dropbox hacked ... will now offer 2-factor authentication</b><br>
       In July 2012, hackers managed to break into the account of an
       employee at dropbox.com, a well-known "cloud storage" site,
       using a stolen password.
       This gave them access they should not have had &mdash; access
       to dropbox.com user information, for example.
       Dropbox.com has decided to offer a <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#T">two-factor authentication</a>
       option (using your cell-phone as the second factor) to add
       another layer of defense against this kind of attack.  Check
       out this
       <a href="../../information-technology/2012/07/dropbox-confirms-it-got-hacked-will-offer-two-factor-authentication/index.htm">arstechnica article</a>.
      </div>
      
      <ul>
        
             <li><b>Why It's Needed</b>. It's hard to remember a long password, especially if it's a good one with lowercase, uppercase, etc.  Thus passwords may be broken, and of course they may be stolen in various ways. One approach to stronger authentication is <em>two-factor authentication</em>.  
               
       <li><b>How It Works</b>. The idea is that to authenticate (for      instance to log into a system), you have to provide <u>two things</u>:
         
         <ul><b>
             <li>something you know (a password, usually)
             <li>something you have or something you are.
         </li></b></ul>
         
       <li><b>Examples</b>. A smart card would be "something you have", while a fingerprint or iris scan would be an example of "something you are" (something inherent to you).   An attacker would have to <em>both</em> have your password and the other factor. An interesting idea that Google uses for gmail (optionally) is that when you initiate login, a text-message is sent to your cell phone with a secret 1-time number.  You enter that number along with your password to authenticate.  Essentially, the cell phone (something you have) is acting as the second factor in this two-factor authentication system.

        <b>Password Cracking in the Navy</b><br>
        Navy commands routinely run password cracking software on their
        own password files to ensure users are using strong passwords.
        Specifically, the Navy uses <a href="http://www.l0phtcrack.com/">L0phtCrack</a>,
        a <a class="glossaryLink" href="calendar.php-76.html?load=glossary#P">program</a> that can crack Windows and UNIX passwords. L0phtCrack
        can be configured to use dictionary attacks (like the attacks we
        performed during the class activities). Results from the routine
        password cracks are reported to and monitored by upper levels of
        the chain of command.
      </div>
      
      <div class="fleet">
        <b>Security means never standing still</b><br>
        To keep their information systems secure, the Navy has to
        constantly update and upgrade not only their hardware and
        software, but even the cryptographic algorithms the hardware and
     software use. 
        MD5 was the standard for a long time, but as researchers started
        to discover flaws (or even <em>potential</em> flaws), the Navy
        had to migrate to a newer, better hashing algorithm, which was
        SHA1.  Even that is now less secure than it was a few years ago.
        Consider this 
        <a href="../../ContentView.aspx.html?id=2413">brief article</a>
     covering the Department of the Navy's announcement that systems
        will be migrating (gradually changing) to a still stronger
        cryptographic hashing algorithm: SHA-256.
