      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      For the past few weeks we have been focused on the topic of networking.  We have discussed
      local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the network (stack) layers.
      You have been exposed to quite a bit of details surrounding the topic of networking.  But
      what does networking have to do with Naval Operations?  In short, a network-centric approach
      to warfighting provides the U.S. Navy a decisive warfighting advantage.  Thus, it is extremely
      important that we protect our networks to enable freedom of action.  In this lecture, we are
      going to discuss network security from an applied perspective.  Specifically, we will introduce
      you to:

      <br><br>

     <li>Network Security
     <li>Defense in Depth 1.0/2.0
     <li>Network Security Devices
     <li>Network Security Architectures

    

    <p>
      <h2>Network Security</h2>

     What exactly does the phrase network security mean?  In layman's terms, network security is
     the term used to apply hardware and software to mitigate the risk of Navy information
     networks and data.  This is a purposely focused definition for the context of our course.
     It is possible to broaden this definition.  For example, we could include policy, authorities,
     and operational aspects to our definition.  However, our focus will be on the hardware and
     software components of network security.

    

    <center><img src="calendar-19.php?key=48ef9ff43ab8d0c7669ac44339f8b1b3c83c5bdd&type=class&event=23" alt="1" width="700" height="300"></center>

    <p><br>

     So what hardware and software can be employed to defend Navy networks?  The answer to that
     question is constantly evolving, as is the technology that underpins network security solutions.
     In the beginning of the age of online communication, data exchange, data storage, and the
     building of databases, network security technology was rather simplified as compared to what
     it is today.  However, as the networks grew more complex and the number of devices on the
     network became more mobile and more varied, the need for an evolution in network security
     became evident.  Thus, a network security solution for a network built and operated in 1990
     doesn't necessarily work for a network in 2018.  But what does that mean?  In short, as
     technology has advanced and evolved, our solutions to secure the network have advanced and
     evolved.  There is never a permanent or static solution, just as technology never remains static.

    </p>

    <center><img src="calendar-20.php?key=3f3c27231059d5451af39c291f098774a65578ce&type=class&event=23" alt="2" width="500" height="300"></center>

    <p>

     Moreover, there is never a one-size-fits-all solution.  Each network is different in design
     and purpose, therefore each network security solution is different.  Given that, there are best
     practices.  Let's begin to explore best practices by first reviewing a topic called Defense in
     Depth.

    </p>

    <p>
      <h2>Defense in Depth</h2>

    How does the DoD think of network security?  The answer is a phrase called Defense in depth.
    Defense in depth is originally a military strategy that seeks to delay rather than prevent the
    advance of an attacker by yielding space to buy time.  If this sounds familiar it's because it
    has been around long before the Cyber Domain.  Consider the below image that conveys multiple
    layers of defense with the intent of stopping an individual from physically accessing what is
    in the locked cabinet.

    

    <center><img src="calendar-21.php?key=4e84cee25a71e848c38403fc787e71266a4aa015&type=class&event=23" alt="3" width="500" height="300"></center>
    
    <br>

    <p>
  
     That is, in order for the human adversary to physically access the information, she must breach
     the perimeter fence, exterior door, office door, and locked cabinet.  All without being detected.
     The Defense in depth model is employed so that at any one of these layers, we (as the keepers of
     what is in the locked cabinet) should be able to detect the adversary - before she gets to what
     is in the locked cabinet.

   </p>

   <p>

    Another example is revealed when we view the formation of a carrier strike group.  War at sea for a
    U.S. Naval Carrier Strike Group (CSG) is based on mutual support of all elements in the group (air, surface, and
    subsurface) and on the principle of defense in depth (i.e., different weapons are used to engage
    targets at various distances from the Strike Group). Defense in depth prescribes three zones in
    which various systems are normally employed to achieve attrition of enemy forces.  The defense-in-depth
    concept, when applied to a war-at-sea scenario, requires a high degree of coordination across all
    zones. However, coordination has its greatest significance in the zones that are covered by multiple
    ship-launched missiles and carrier-based aircraft.

   </p>

    <center><img src="calendar-22.php?key=91d339a5eb3134eee106551c5bbea65a9607062a&type=class&event=23" alt="4" width="800" height="300"></center>
    
    <br>

   <p>

   This very same model is applied in the Cyber Domain.  In fact, the same tactical concepts hold true.
   It was originally applied to the Cyber Domain by the National Security Agency (NSA).  So how do we
   delay the advance of an adversary against our networks?  Take a look at the below visual.  It depicts
   a Defense in depth security architecture in the context of the Cyber Domain.  That is, hardware and
   software in the context of a (unique) network with the intent of highlighting the Defense in depth
   concept.

   </p>

    <center><img src="calendar-23.php?key=d11a4d50ef82660d57deed1ce12f46b4bdc310c6&type=class&event=23" alt="5" width="700" height="300"></center>

  <p>

  By reviewing the visual above it is obvious to see three key components.  That is, the need for
  visibility, need to correlate, and need for a remediation response.  You will note that there are
  devices and software under each of the gray boxes containing that text.  Our goal is that one of
  these devices will detect the adversary and allows us to prevent further advancement.  We do so by
  correlating data generated by the devices, and ultimately, remediating the cyber attack.

  </p>

  <p>

  As with the technology (hardware and software) that underpins the Defense in depth model, the model
  itself has evolved over time.  Why the change?  Because we have moved from a network-centric
  architecture to a perimeter-less architecture where mobile devices, applications, and information
  assets are available anywhere and anytime.  Thus, the Defense in depth model has had to evolve by
  accounting for the new usability requirements of the users.  We will cover the architectures this
  model applies to below.  But first, let's explore who provides network security for the U.S. Navy.

  </p>
<!--
  <p>
    <h2>Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command (NCDOC)</h2>

  <center><img src="calendar.php?key=4f78a98fed9d6a55c4f563e09d0c133b718c4c90&type=class&event=23" alt="6" width="700" height="100"></center>

  <br>
  <br>

   Within the Fleet, who is responsible for network security?  The Navy Cyber Defense Operations
   Command or NCDOC.  The mission of NCDOC is to <b><i>execute defensive cyberspace operations, and enable
   global power projection through proactive network defense</b></i>.

  </p>

  <p>

   For context, NCDOC is a navy cyber defense task force, the Commanding Officer holds the title Commander Task Force (CTF) 1020, and operationally reports to  U.S Fleet Cyber Command / U.S. Tenth Fleet.  The primary organization that contains members of the Information Warfare Community (IWC) discussed in our previous lecture. NCDOC is primarily composed of members of the Information Professional (182X) Community (Officers) and their enlisted counterparts Information Technicians (IT). A recent visit by the Commander of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command / U.S. Tenth Fleet to NCDOC revealed the following comment:

  </p>

  <p>

    <center><i>"At NCDOC we strive to execute defensive cyberspace operations with a mindset that
      allows for consistent processes to operate globally, with our regional partners as necessary,
      but that also empowers us to remain adaptive, with the <b><u>agility</b></u> necessary to
      <b><u>pivot</b></u> in order to maneuver effectively. This is <b><u>not a static
      domain</b></u></i> so we do not execute ops that way"</center>

  </p>

   Agility is a key component of any cyberspace operation, but what exactly does that mean?  In
   network security, this can mean being flexible in accomplishing daily tasks as well as the
   method of working, or doing things at pace and experimenting.  The backbone of agility is
   resilience.  It's the unexpected we have to deal with and the only way to deal with that is
   being agile.  But what exactly do these defensive cyberspace operators have to be agile with?
   Beyond the environment itself, the specifics are the tools (hardware and software) they need
   to use, or create on a daily basis.  Let’s explore some of the fundamental hardware and software
   a defensive cyber operator would use as it pertains to network security.

    <h2>Network Security Devices & Applications</h2>

   Network security is comprised of the hardware and software the defensive cyber operator uses to
   enable proactive network defense.  Devices are synonymous with hardware and applications are
   synonymous with software.  In this section we are going to explore the individual hardware and
   software that are commonly used in network security.

  

  <p>

  <i><b>Firewalls</b></i>

  <br>
  <br>

  A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and
  decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.   A firewall is configured with a set of rules, called an Access Control List (ACL), which it uses to determine for each and every packet it sees whether to forward the packet to its destination or drop it (i.e. filter it out). ACL rules can forward or drop based on the sender's and recipient's IP addresses, port number, and protocol (i.e. UDP/TCP)

  </p>

  <p>

  Firewalls have been a first line of defense in network security for over 25 years. They
  establish a barrier between secured and controlled internal networks that can be trusted and
  untrusted outside networks, such as the Internet.

  </p>

  <p>

  A firewall can be hardware, software, or both.  In fact, each midshipmen has a software firewall
  included with the Microsoft operating system you use on a daily basis.  Hardware firewalls come
  in many different shapes and sizes as can be seen below, and their functionality is extensive.
  What functionality is applied is determined by each organization, based on operational needs,
  and implemented by the cyber defensive operator.

  <p>
  Windows 10 has a built-in firewall. That means that the operating system filters all network coming into and out of your PC. You can pull up the firewall from the Windows shell (command prompt) with the command Firewall.cpl. If you click on "Advanced Settings" in the resulting window, and then click on "Inbound Rules", you should see some of the ACL rules that define your firewall's behavior. For example, the first rule I see informs me that ICMP traffic is allowed in. If I turned this off, I would become un-ping-able!  Firewalls can also be placed in routers. This allows us to control access and services in and out of a network, rather than in and out of a single host. Let's look at one concrete example of the consequences of doing something like this. Consider the following two networks, which are connected by a router.
  </p>
    
    <center><img src="calendar.php-51.png?key=aac7b8036231deb5c2383cb422487f6f476e76fc&type=class&event=23" alt="7" width="600" height="200"></center>
  
  <p><br>
  Suppose the firewall in this diagram is configured with an ACL rule that drops (i.e. filters out) all traffic into the router via the firewall that is bound for port 80. What is the effect in terms of services? Hosts on network 8.55.221.0 could access a web server within their own network, since traffic within their own network never goes through the router. Moreover, these hosts could access a web server on the 111.5.22.0 network, because that traffic, while indeed bound for port 80, is going out of the router via the firewall and so is not stopped by the rule. However, hosts from the 111.5.22.0 network cannot access a web server (assuming it's listening on port 80) on the 8.55.221.0 network.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  So where you place a firewall within a network affects the way it controls access to network services.

      var bid = 'bb' + n, did = 'dd' + n;
      var theButton = document.getElementById(bid);
      var theDiv = document.getElementById(did);
      if (theButton.innerHTML == '+')
      {
      theButton.innerHTML = '-';
      theDiv.style.display = 'block';
      }
      else
      {
      theButton.innerHTML = '+';
      theDiv.style.display = 'none';

  <div id="dd1" style="display:none">  

      We are assuming a generic ACL language for this exercise. Our ACL will only be capable of filtering IP addresses and TCP or UDP port numbers. ACL rules will look like what you see in the image to the right.  Remember: Firewalls evaluate each rule in an ACL in order from top to bottom. Once a packet meets the criteria of a rule, the prescribed action is taken (forward or drop) and the remaining rules in the list are ignored. If the packet does not meet the criteria of any rule, then the packet is dropped by default. The next packet received is scanned and evaluated against the ACL starting over with the first rule in the list. This process repeats for each packet received by the firewall.
    <br><br>
Scenario: You are a network administrator responsible for an HTTP server at 10.10.10.8, a DNS server at 10.10.10.16, and a SMB file server at 10.10.10.32 and you are tasked with designing an ACL for your organization's firewall for inbound Internet traffic. Your ACL must enforce the following criteria:
<ul>

<li>The file server is used for storage of important documents and should not be accessible to external IP addresses.</li>
<li>The web server hosts the organization web site, which must be accessible to all IP addresses.</li>
<li>The DNS server provides name resolution for the organization's domain, which must be available to all IP addresses.</li>
<li>IP addresses 7.7.7.7 and 8.8.8.8 are prohibited from accessing any host on your network due to suspected hacking activity (this overrides any other rule).</li>
</ul>
Below is your ACL. Initially it just has a rule that forwards everything (not very secure!), you can add rules, remove rules and move rules with the controls below. Build an ACL that meets your network's requirements, and test with the "Test Firewall" button.

<p>
<span><strong>Note:</strong> 
      The last rule must match all packets so that every packet
      is matched by at least one rule.  Therefore forward/drop is
      the only thing you can choose.</span>

  <p>
    <i><b>Whitelist</b></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Whitelists are a method of access control utilized by security administrators to prevent unauthorized
    user usage of a service, privilege, application, or network. Whitelists consist of an Access Control
    List (ACL) with specific users, applications, IP addresses, or MAC addresses that are allowed access to
    the object being protected. The USNA intranet operates using the whitelist principle. When
    you use a Nimitz Library computer you have to sign in using your Midshipmen user account.
    Your Midshipmen user account is part of a whitelist owned by ITSD that only allows approved users, such
    as Midshipmen and instructors to access the services provided by the computers.
    
  </p>
    
    
  <p>
    <i><b>Blacklist</b></i>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    Conversely, Defensive Cyber Operators can use another access control method, aptly called a blacklist.
    Instead of allowing specific users access, the access control system denies entry to specific users,
    programs, IP addresses, or MAC addresses contained in the ACL. These ACLs are often created based on
    information from previous intrusions. Network security companies try to share their ACLs with each
    other so that others don't fall victim to attempted or successful exploitation from known exploits or
    adversary IP and MAC addresses.
    
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Given that blacklists are restricted to known variables, they require constant updating to keep up with
    rapidly evolving malware and threats. Whitelists don't need to be updated as frequently, but it takes time to go
    through the process of approving a user and adding them to the whitelist, which can frustrate users and
    result in wasted manpower when authorized users are unable to access the tools they need to perform their
    duties. Almost every access control system will use a combination of whitelists and blacklists in order to
    achieve a best of both worlds scenario.
  
  </p>
    
  <p>

    <i><b>Intrusion Detection Systems</b></i>

    <br>
    <br>

   An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a system that monitors network traffic for suspicious
   activity and issues alerts when such activity is discovered.  This is similar to a speed camera.
   Cars passing the camera are automatically detected.  Those cars not following a set of predefined
   rules (the speed limit) are flagged for suspicious behavior.

  </p>

    <center><img src="calendar-25.php?key=ab6b35ba487d7f4e1dbeec844cd95174f39b18f7&type=class&event=23" alt="8" width="600" height="200"></center>

  <p><br>

   Similarly, as network traffic flows pass the IDS, that network traffic which is not part of a
   predefined set of legitimate traffic is flagged for suspicious behavior.  This is shown in the
   visual below whereby the NetworkSentry device acts as the IDS.

  </p>

    <center><img src="calendar-26.php?key=04c7a3b7bb69a30a96e91b6f564fcdeedb7da8c0&type=class&event=23" alt="9" width="500" height="400"></center>

  <p><br>

   Where you place the speeding camera and the IDS is important.  For example, if you place the
   speeding camera in a location where there is no cars passing by, the odds of detecting
   someone speeding decreases. Likewise, where you place the IDS within the network architecture
   will determine the ability to detect suspicious behavior.

  </p>

  <p>

    <i><b>Intrusion Prevention Systems</b></i>

    <br>
    <br>

   An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is a network security/threat prevention technology that
   examines network traffic flows to detect and prevent vulnerability exploits. It works very
   similar to an IDS.

  </p>

  <p>

   Attackers use exploits to gain access (or hack) a system.  Exploits usually come in the form of
   malicious inputs (code) to a target application or service that attackers use to interrupt and
   gain control of an application or machine.  Because an exploit may be carried out very quickly
   after the attacker gains access, intrusion prevention systems also have the ability to take
   immediate action, based on a set of rules established by the Defensive Cyber Operators.  For
   example, an IPS might drop a packet that it determines to be malicious and block all further
   traffic from that attacker IP address or port. Legitimate traffic, meanwhile, would be forwarded
   to the recipient with no apparent disruption or delay of service.

  </p>

  <p>

   Don't be confused by the two network security appliances.  An IDS and IPS are very similar.
   See the below visual for a quick snapshot of the difference between the two.

  </p>

      <center><img src="calendar.php-52.png?key=af4cc28b84a296580ff82e66f7973bb9943a4446&type=class&event=23" alt="10" width="500" height="400"></center>

  <p>

    <i><b>Email Security</b></i>

    <br>
    <br>

   An email security gateway is a product or service that is designed to prevent the transmission
   of emails that break company policy, send malware or transfer information with malicious intent.

 </p>

 <p>

  For example, the email security application may inspect the contents of the email being sent from
  the organization to an external customer.  If proprietary information is discovered, the email
  may not be sent.  Similarly, if an adversary attempts to email malicious files to an employee
  of the organization, it may be stopped at the appliance, before reaching the employee and
  potentially compromising the network.

 </p>

 <p>

  To give you an idea of how this works, consider the below visual.  While there are many
  different vendors and types of email security appliances, the below visual shows a Cisco
  product.

 </p>

       <center><img src="calendar-27.php?key=1bf6adad67e154834fe766ab8e8fc5f37e1846d4&type=class&event=23" alt="11" width="600" height="300"></center>

      <br>
  <p>

    <i><b>Network Segmentation</b></i>

    <br>
    <br>

    Network segmentation is the act of splitting a network into many “sub networks” known as
    segments. This approach allows organizations to group applications and like data together
    for access by a specific group (e.g., finance, operations, HR, engineering, etc).  By
    taking a larger connected network, and segregating it into smaller sub networks, we
    limit the range of access provided to an insider, partner, or a third party.

  </p>

  <p>

   Consider this example of teaching the CYBERWAR class.  There are roughly 30 sections taught
   every semester.  There are multiple options to teach the class.  We could cram 100 students
   into a large lecture hall and host 6 or 7 classes.  Or, we can divide the class into 30
   sections of 20 students each.  There are pros and cons to both.  The larger classes would
   require less Professors, but the students would have less one-on-one opportunities.  A
   smaller class allows for the Professor to better manage the class, material, and content;
   but it requires more resources to execute all of the classes.

  </p>

       <center><img src="calendar-28.php?key=f8842b628c9c884e44c29aa8cf3b23527454ac39&type=class&event=23" alt="12" width="600" height="300"></center>

  <p>

   Similarly, network segmentation allows us divide the network into smaller groups with the
   intent of better security management.  We can better secure the smaller networks, make sure
   groups do not have access to one another's data, and prevent

    <i><b>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</b></i>

    <br>
    <br>

   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) allow you to connect two or more private networks over a public
   network. In essence, VPNs allow you to act and appear as though you are connected directly to
   a LAN. This is achieved by creating a connection between two endpoints and creating a virtual
   tunnel between the two locations. One of the primary goals of VPNs is to encrypt the data as
   it travels over the public networks.

  </p>

       <center><img src="calendar-29.php?key=4f67ee7430ccd759d8d37efd40b679595f24909e&type=class&event=23" alt="13" width="600" height="300"></center>

  <p><br>

   VPN connections are enabled via protocols.  The protocols include:

  </p>

 <li>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) - A suite of protocols operating at the internet layer with support built directly into the kernel of most operating systems.
 <li>Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) - Frequently used to secure web pages, TLS was originally an upgrade to the SSL 3.0.
 <li>Secure Shell (SSH) - More than just a program to connect into other systems, SSH supports tunneling, file transfer (SFTP), secure copy (SCP).
 <li>Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) - Used in commercial products like Cisco AnyConnect.

   <i><b>Wireless Security</b></i>

   <br>
   <br>

  Utilizing radio frequency (RF) methods to transmit data over relatively short distances, WLANs or
  WiFi, can significantly reduce the needs for a wired connections while giving users more freedom
  of movement.

 

 <p>

  The various 802.11 protocols support different methods of protecting data. In 1999 Wired Equivalent
  Privacy (WEP) became the standard. Initial implementations used only 64-bit encryption, although
  128 and 256 bit variants were developed. Within a few years proof-of-concept exploits were available
  and by 2005 public demonstrations showed that the WEP keys could be found within minutes. While the
  Wi-Fi Alliance retired WEP in 2004 it continues to be added to wireless routers as the default settings.

 </p>

 <p>

Wi-Fi Protected Access was adopted in 2003 in an attempt to respond the increasing vulnerabilities
of WEP. WPA keys are 256-bit and adds the ability to detect whether an attacker has altered packets
passed between the access point and the user, and implemented the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
(TKIP). TKIP was designed to use the same hardware as WEP and in an attempt to reuse some of the
WEP systems, these vulnerabilities were ultimately exploited. WPA eventually replaced TKIP with the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

 </p>


 <p>

  Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) superseded WPA in 2006. While WPA2 has similar issues with
  WPS (which should always be turned off), it is considerably more capable then either WPA or
  WEP, and for most purposes is more than adequate for home networks. There are concerns for
  WPA2 at the enterprise, as an attacker with access to the network (already on the network)
  can work to obtain keys and perform certain attacks against other devices.

 </p>


   <i><b>Conclusion</b></i>

  <p><br>

   In this section we have discussed some of the network devices and applications a defensive
   cyber operator may use for achieving a secure network.  By no means is this all encompassing.
   As was mentioned earlier, each network is unique and the specific devices and applications to
   be applied will also be unique.  Applying best practices is a common theme in network security,
   but being agile and resilient is also necessary.

  </p>

Now you have an understanding of some specific types of network security devices and application defensive cyber operators may use in an agile fashion to provide proactive network defense.
Given that, how are these devices applied in a secure network architecture?

 

<p>

Secure networks are crucial for IT systems and their proper operations as most applications work
in the networking environment and closely depend on its performance, reliability, and security.
Improper network design can be very expensive for an organization (i.e., loss of business
continuity, security incidents, costs of network rebuilding, etc.). Essential to network design
is the security architecture that describes the network segmentation (i.e., security zones) and
security layers (i.e., access control, intrusion prevention, content inspection, etc.). An
appropriate design of the architecture provides many advantages (e.g., isolation of low trust
systems, limitation of a security breach scope, costs savings).

While there are endless design possibilities, the below visual provides security network
design principles of Defense in depth applied.
