      <h2>Our First Discussion <!--SPAN class="samePageLink">[<A href="#top">Top</A>]</SPAN--></h2>
      
      <h3>President's 60-Day Cyberspace Policy Review</h3>
    <p>
      21st century societies rely on information to make informed decisions about every aspect of life due to the inherent value information contains through
    the benefits it provides to its owners. However, individuals and/or groups authorized to utilize information must maintain possession of their information
    and keep it out reach from those who seek to use it for their own advantage. Securing information has been an important aspect throughout history and
    the widespread use of a public internet has created an environment in which information can be compromised from any geographic location.
    </p>
    <p>
    Internet related vulnerabilities can be traced back to the 1980's and have grown exponentially more complex and numerous in the decades since.
    The United States is a wealthy and powerful nation and maintaining an uninterrupted and uncompromised flow of information is vital to our continued
    success. In May of 2009 President Obama directed a <em>60-Day Cyberspace Policy Review</em> which among a variety of recommendations included and action item to
    "<em>expand and train the workforce, including ... cyber security expertise in the Federal government</em>". In the fall semester of 2011 the
    Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy directed that an <em>Introduction to Cyber Security</em> course be added as part of the core
    curriculum for all Midshipmen to fulfill the action item from the <em>2009 60-Day Cyberspace Policy Review</em> and prepare future Officers for the
    Cyberspace challenges they will encounter in the Navy and Marine Corps.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Cyber Domain: What is it?</h3>
    <p>
   The term "Cyber" is relatively new (first mentioned in the 1970's) and professionals have not reached a consensus on what Cyber means. That being said,
   the term Cyber is so widely used that most people have a general idea of what it entails. For the purpose of this course we will use the following two
   definitions when thinking about Cyber:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Common: In Layman's terms the Cyber domain is "<em>the domain characterized by the 'human' use of electronics and the electromagnetic spectrum to store,
    modify, and exchange data via networked systems and associated physical infrastructures</em>."</li>
    <br>
    <li>
    Department of Defense: The Joint Publication 3-12 on Cyberspace Operations (JP 3-12) defines the Cyber domain as "<em>a global domain within the
    information environment consisting of the interdependent networks of information technology infrastructures and resident data, including the
    Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers</em>."</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Major Cyber Security Incidents</h3>
    <p>
    Over the past 10 years an ever growing number of high profile incidents have caught the attention of governments, organizations, companies, and
    individuals around the world. Understanding these incidents and their implications will help Navy and Marine Corps Officers understand the challenges
    they may be confronted with in the fleet and how to avoid becoming the subject of a future Cyber incident. Below are some of the most significant and
    impactful Cyber incidents in recent years:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b><em><a href="https://www.public.navy.mil/fcc-c10f/Fact%20Sheets/Navy%20Unit%20Commendation.2014.pdf">Operation Rolling Tide</a></em></b>:
    was the Navy's first officially named Cyber Operation. The operation was initiated in response to Iranian intrusion into an unclassified Navy network.
    The amount of information and the usefulness is not publicly known, but the Navy recognized the importance of dedicated incident response defense
    teams and stood up the <em>Cyber Mission Force</em> to defend networks and rapidly respond to breaches.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b><em><a href="../../articles/u-s-suspects-hackers-in-china-behind-government-data-breach-sources-say-1433451888.html">Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Hack</a></em></b>:
    In April of 2015 the Office of Personnel Management, the federal government's human resources department, announced a breach and data theft that
    affected an estimated 22 million government employees, many of which included military members and possibly your instructor. U.S. government
    officials suspected Chinese hackers based on investigations. Most of those affected only had their security clearance file information stolen, but an
    estimated 4 million employees also had social security numbers, addresses, fingerprints, performance evaluations, and job assignment information
    stolen.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b><em><a href="../../magazine/story/2018/07/17/dnc-server-hack-russia-trump-2016-219017.html">Democratic National Committee (DNC) Email Leak</a></em></b>:
    In 2014 a Russian intelligence and hacking group operating under the name <em>Internet Research Agency</em> began targeting various organizations
    involved in the upcoming 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. In March of 2016 John Podesta, the Hillary Clinton campaign chairman, and others were targeted
    by <b><em>spear-phishing emails</em></b>, which we'll talk more about later in the course. One spear-phishing email successfully obtained the login
    credentials for John Podesta's email account allowing hackers to steal over 50,000 emails. The DNC Email Leak is only a small part of a larger
    investigation into suspected Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b><em><a href="../../article/3233210/petya-ransomware-and-notpetya-malware-what-you-need-to-know-now.html">Petya and Notpetya</a></em></b>:
    are malware that affected Microsoft Windows computer in 2016 and 2017. Petya is a ransomware, a type of malware that prevents victims from accessing
    their data and requires the victim to pay a ransom in order to regain access to their information. Notpetya closely resembles Petya, but is not a
    ransomware and only exists to prevent users from accessing their data with no hope of ever recovering it. Loss of data can cause billions of dollars in
    lost productivity and countries like North Korea and Russia use cyber crime to boost their treasuries when their economies suffer from sanctions and
    other negative factors.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b><em><a href="../../threat-center/threat-profiles/ics-malware-variants/blackenergy/index.htm">Black Energy</a></em></b>:
    is a malware currently in its 3rd version that was used to take Ukrainian power distribution centers offline in 2015, leaving 230,000 Ukrainians without electricity
    for 6 hours. The incident didn't affect a huge percentage of Ukraine's population and wasn't extremely costly, but incited fear in Ukrainians and many
    others around the world because it demonstrated that a group had the capability to cause power outages and could potentially expand the
    scale of their attack to affect a much larger population for a longer duration.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b><em><a href="../../story/equifax-breach-no-excuse/index.htm">Equifax Hack</a></em></b>:
    In May of 2017, hackers used a known vulnerability to gain access to the personal data systems of Equifax, one of the three major U.S. credit reporting
    companies. The attackers stole the personal data of 143 million people and put every single one of the victims at risk for financial and identity fraud. The
    hack occurred due to a failure to fix/patch the vulnerability two months after it had been publicly distributed. The hack brought attention to the private
    sector's responsibility to protect consumer data and is still a topic of intense debate.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Science Fiction Meets Reality</h3>
    <p>
    For decades writers and computer experts have imagined scenarios of digital chaos, advanced hackers, and real-world physical consequences, but few
    groups had the knowledge and capabilities to conduct such extensive operations until recently. In recent years we've seen real incidents that appear
    more and more like those from movies, so much so that fiction and reality have become difficult to distinguish.
