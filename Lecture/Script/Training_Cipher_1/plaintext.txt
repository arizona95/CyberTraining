Along with liberation, the Naval Academy was opened to foster elite naval officers who will protect the seas of the motherland by Admiral Son Won-il and other marine pioneers.

The elite guardianships produced by the Naval Academy have dedicated themselves to their motherland, and are still striving to raise the status of Korea in all parts of the world.

Like the adage that those who rule the sea dominate the world, we will meet the expectations of the nation and the people by nurturing talented people who protect the sea, which is our place of living and the channel of national prosperity.

We look forward to your continued interest and support for our Naval Academy. Thank you.
